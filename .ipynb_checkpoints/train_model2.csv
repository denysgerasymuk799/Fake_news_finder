0,THE US AND THE WEST ARE BEHIND HONG KONG PROTESTS,"SUMMARY
Russia agrees with China’s stance on US and Western interventions in Hong Kong. China has compelling evidence that the United States and Western countries are behind the protests and illegal actions in the province of Hong Kong. 
DISPROOF
A recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative and conspiracy theory about the Hong Kong protests presented without evidence.
Pro-Kremlin media have long used the narrative about anti-government protests being funded by the US. Examples include colour revolutions in post-Soviet states, the “Arab Spring” revolts, and Ukraine's Euromaidan in 2014. Western non-governmental organisations are often targeted by pro-Kremlin disinformation as agents of this subversive and state-driven influence.
The Hong Kong protests began in June 2019 because of a controversial extradition law that would allow for the transfer of suspects to face trial on the Chinese mainland.

1,THE PROTESTS IN HONG KONG ARE US-FUNDED,"SUMMARY
A growing backlash has begun across Hong Kong against US-funded protests that have attempted to disrupt governance and commerce as part of a floundering movement to maintain Western influence in the region.

2,THE WEST MIGHT USE THE EASTERN EUROPEANS AS CANNON FODDER FOR A NEW “BARBAROSSA”,"SUMMARY
Washington (and to a large degree Brussels) are engaged in fostering [Russophobia] so as to not just create a bulwark against the mythical “Russian aggression”, but also a possible staging ground for another “Barbarossa”. Of course, just like in 1938 when they were using Czechs as a bargaining chip, it’s not a big issue for the West to use modern Eastern Europeans as cannon fodder in a possible future confrontation with Russia, leaving the West unscathed. However, this time, it would be quite different as more than 6,000 Russian nukes disagree.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory, presented without evidence. The article is consistent with a disinformation narrative about Russophobia and about Western belligerence towards Russia.",REAL
3,UKRAINE WILL TURN LAND INTO A COMMODITY AND SELL IT IN EXCHANGE FOR ANOTHER BILLION FROM THE IMF,"SUMMARY
Apparently, the new Kyiv government is in a hurry to turn natural wealth into a commodity and sell it to Western partners in exchange for another billion from the IMF.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the requirements of the IMF and its work in Ukraine.
The IMF constantly talked about the need for land reform in Ukraine, but in 2017 this requirement was postponed. In January 2019, the fund again spoke about the necessity of the land market, naming this reform among the opportunities to fundamentally transform the Ukrainian economy.
During the conference “Land as a factor in the development of the Ukrainian village,” President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that “in the model that we offer with the government, only Ukrainian citizens or Ukrainian companies can buy or sell land. Horror stories about the Chinese, Arabs or aliens who will take our land by wagons - this is nonsense. The land is the property of citizens,” said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture of Ukraine has published a draft law that will open the land market next year. The explanatory note lists those who will be able to buy ownership of agricultural land: “citizens of Ukraine, territorial communities, the state, legal entities of Ukraine and foreign citizens or stateless persons in case of acquisition by inheritance and the obligation to alienate the plot during the year.”",REAL
4,EP RESOLUTION IS AN IDEOLOGICAL WEAPON AGAINST RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
The claim that Communism and Nazism were similar – stressed in the recent EU Parliament resolution – is an EU ideological weapon against Russia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative claiming that the recognition and denunciation of Stalinist crimes against humanity are Western anti-Russian propaganda.
The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stresses the vital importance of remembering victims of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes - and of raising awareness of the crimes committed by Communist and Nazi regimes - for the unity of Europe and for building European resilience against modern external threats.
The resolution recalls that Nazi and Stalinist regimes carried out mass murder, genocide and deportation and caused a loss of life and freedom in the 20th century on a scale unseen in human history. It stresses that Russia remains the greatest victim of communist totalitarianism. The resolution argues that both Nazism and Stalinism were totalitarian regimes. The concept of totalitarianism – which highlights the profound similarities between Nazism and Communism – is not an ideological weapon. The concept of totalitarianism is very widely accepted among contemporary political scientists and historians, including Russian scholars.",REAL
5,ESTONIA FIGHTS WITH ITS NEIGHBOURS FOR MONEY FROM US DEFENCE BUDGET,"SUMMARY
Tallinn is fighting furiously with its competitors – Vilnius and Riga – to get funding from the US for it’s military investment projects. This explains the endless flow of messages about unproven “violations” of Estonian airspace by Russian aircraft. Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation has been constantly disproving the unproven claims of Estonia.
Vilnius and Riga lack such “convenient” islands like Estonias Vaindloo, but they attempt to find ways to accuse Russia in provocations on border. They do it like Estonia does, without providing proof.
DISPROOF
The Baltics don't have to fight for the money from the US defence budget and support their claims with airspace violations. It was Russia, who violated the territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia and those examples still work very well. At the 2014 summit in Wales, all of the NATO members agreed to spend 2 percent of their GDPs on the defense by the year 2025. Estonia's defence budget reaches above this mark with spending 2,13 per cent of the GDP on defence.
Russian military aircraft frequently violate Estonian airspace. The latest example comes from 23rd of September when a Sukhoi Su-34 fighter violated Estonian airspace near the island of Vaindloo. The plane's transponder was turned off and no flight plan was filed. The aircraft had no radio contact with the Estonian Air Traffic Control. As a result of the incident, Moscow’s ambassador to Estonia was summoned to the Foreign Ministry.
Previous examples from September also include Lithuania: ""On Sept. 3, NATO air policing fighter jets intercepted two Sukhoi SU-30 aircraft flying from the mainland of the Russian Federation to Kaliningrad. Neither had their onboard transponder on, nor flight plans, nor kept radio contact with the regional air traffic control center. On Sept. 5, fighter jets were scrambled to intercept an aircraft maneuvering in the Lithuanian Flight Information Region (FIR) of the international airspace after flowing in from Kaliningrad. The onboard transponder of the aircraft was off, it did not have a flight plan, and did not maintain radio communication with the regional air traffic control center.""",REAL
6,UKRAINE INTERFERED IN US ELECTIONS,"SUMMARY
Ukraine interfered in US elections in 2016. When the information about Manafort was published, Trump’s ratings plummeted.
DISPROOF

7,THE US PROMOTES ‘BALKANISATION’ OF MEXICO TO ANNEX RICH NORTHERN REGIONS,"SUMMARY
Secessionist plans to ‘balkanise’ Mexico by the [Mexican] opposition National Action Party (PAN) are gaining traction. At the same time, US Republican senator Daniel McCarthy threatens to “annex Mexico”, reviving the ashes of Nueva Vizcaya and the Republic of the Rio Grande in the 19th century. For two decades Mexico’s ‘balkanisation’ has been a strategic issue for the US.
DISPROOF
No evidence is provided to support the claim, other than a tweet by a politician of a minoritarian party, who said that the north of the country could be much more developed if it could get rid of the southern poor regions of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero. It is true that governors of the states ruled by the National Action Party created an association to oppose the politics of Mexico's president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, but there is nothing pointing to a separatist movement trying to re-establish the entity of Nueva Vizcaya (the first region explored and settled by the Spanish conquerors in the north of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in the 16th century) or the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande (a secessionist attempt in the 19th century).
Also, senator Daniel McCarthy didn’t “threaten” to annex Mexico. Though controversial, his proposal was that if so many Mexicans want to become US citizens, they should start a petition to the Congress in Washington for their territories to become US States.
This is part of a long-established pro-Kremlin narrative about the alleged US promotion of separatism in different regions as a means to destabilize rival countries, as Santa Cruz province in Bolivia or the oil-rich Zulia region in Venezuela. In Mexico’s case, the targeted area would be the so-called Burgos basin, rich in shale gas, which opened to private investment in 2017.

8,NATO IS PURSUING A REAL WAR-PREPARATION POLICY FOR EUROPE,"SUMMARY
The USA is increasingly expanding its military presence in Eastern Europe. It is a continuation and strengthening of the policy of confrontation with Russia, which has absolutely determined NATO policy for the last fifteen years. It is another step in the wrong direction – more troops, more military bases; more weapons on the border with Russia do not secure peace, but the opposite. They only show that NATO is actually pursuing a real war preparation policy, not a common security policy for Europe.
DISPROOF
No evidence given that the US and NATO started to prepare for war with Russia. Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, portraying NATO as a threat to peace and having a belligerent agenda in Eastern Europe.
NATO policies introduced after the 2014 Ukraine crisis, aimed at reinforcing NATO’s Eastern flank and reassuring Central and Eastern European allies worried about possible threats from Russia, do not threaten global security. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the Readiness Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defence and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment.",REAL
9,GRETA THUNBERG IS A PROPHET OF A NEW TOTALITARIAN WAVE EQUALING TO RADICAL ISLAM,"SUMMARY
Greta Thunberg, a sick girl who is as stupid as she is naive, is the prophet of the new totalitarian wave, which is something like radical Islam for the post-Christian West.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about climate change, and an attack on Greta Thunberg. See similar cases here and here.
The message perpetuate a disinformation narrative that global warming is a ""hoax"" perpetrated by special interest groups like green business that stand to benefit from climate hysteria.
In fact, the existence of anthropogenic climate change and is a matter of scientific consensus. Only a tiny minority of scientists dispute this consensus: the Earth is warming through the greenhouse effect; human activities - including use of fossil fuels, cutting down rainforests, and farming livestock - are a major cause of the warming; and, unchecked, this rapid warming presents significant risks to human communities and natural systems. We are already seeing impacts from global warming today. No other environmental threat has been subjected to as much scientific research. The EU Member States and the US government has spent billions of dollars on climate science across many agencies and universities. The UN has assembled thousands of scientists to compile and review the latest science and contribute to the publication of five reports since 1990 that have consistently made the consensus deeper and the warnings more urgent. Preventing the dangerous consequences of the climate change is a key priority for the EU. ",REAL
10,"Hong Kong Protests: Fading Foreign Tantrum, Not Genuine Revolution","Just as unfolded in 2014 during the so-called “Umbrella protests” or “Occupy Central” movement, a growing backlash has begun across Hong Kong against US-funded protests that have attempted to disrupt governance and commerce as part of a floundering movement to maintain Western influence in the region.
The Sydney Morning Herald in its article, “Triads linked to violent pro-China gangs as Hong Kong protests enter dangerous new phase,” ignored weeks of violence carried out by US-backed protests in Hong Kong, and portrayed locals retaliating as “violent pro-China gangs.” It should be pointed out that Hong Kong is in China.
The article claims:
Turbulence in Hong Kong has reached a dangerous new phase, analysts say, amid escalating violence and the failure of Chief Executive Carrie Lam to respond to the political crisis. 
Television broadcasts on Monday were dominated by scenes of white-shirted men believed to be triad members caning and chasing train commuters as they hunted for democracy protesters on Sunday evening. People screamed as the gangs entered train carriages at Yuen Long station.
Having failed to attract wider public support, US-backed protesters have begun resorting to increasingly disruptive activities including raiding government buildings, storming commercial districts to intimidate visitors from mainland China and even targeting public transportation.
Backlash Follows Weeks of Violence and Vandalism by Pro-Western Protests
Before the SMH’s “violent pro-China gangs” showed up, US-backed protesters had admittedly stormed Hong Kong’s Legislative Council (LegCo) building. The BBC in its article, “Hong Kong police evict protesters who stormed parliament,” admitted:
Activists had occupied the Legislative Council (LegCo) building for hours after breaking away from a protest on the anniversary of Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty to China from Britain.
The BBC also admitted the protesters carried out vandalism inside the building:
Inside, they defaced the emblem of Hong Kong in the central chamber, raised the old British colonial flag, spray-painted messages across the walls, and shattered furniture.
The Financial Times in their article, “Hong Kong protesters target Chinese government office,” mentioned another government building targeted by the protesters, the Liaison Office for Hong Kong representing Beijing. The article reported:
Demonstrators spray-painted over the lenses of security cameras in front of the building and one threw an egg that splattered on its glass facade. Others wrote graffiti on a wall including an insult against China, and defaced lettering on the building’s gate.
The Guardian attempted to conceal the nature of the protests in its article, “Hong Kong protest ends in chaotic clashes between police and demonstrators,” which was ultimately about protesters targeting a shopping centre popular with mainland visitors.
The article would claim:
Violent clashes have erupted between Hong Kong police and protesters at the end of a peaceful demonstration against the controversial extradition bill. The incidents took place late on Sunday in a bustling town between Hong Kong island and the border with China. The scene descended into chaos shortly before 10pm local time (1400 GMT), after riot police chased protesters into a shopping centre in Sha Tin.
However, the Financial Times in its article, “Hong Kong protesters try to woo Chinese tourists to their cause,” admitted the protesters intentionally targeted the shopping centre rather than merely being “chased into it.” The article admits:
Hong Kong protesters against a controversial extradition bill for the first time targeted a busy shopping district popular with mainland Chinese tourists in an attempt to raise awareness of the issue across the border.
A recently built high-speed train station connecting Hong Kong with mainland China was also targeted. AFP-JIJI in its article, “Hong Kong protesters march on station to get message across to visiting Chinese mainlanders,” would admit:
Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters on Sunday rallied outside a controversial train station linking the territory to the Chinese mainland, the latest mass show of anger as activists try to keep pressure on the city’s pro-Beijing leaders. 
The US-backed protesters have also targeted journalists. The New York Times in its article, “Hong Kong Protesters’ New Target: A News Station Seen as China’s Friend,” attempted to defend the targeting of journalists perceived as being “pro-Beijing” claiming:
The confrontation on Wednesday, when the TVB journalist was surrounded, was not an isolated incident. Last month, protesters heckled another TVB video journalist, unfurling umbrellas to block his camera and chanting, “TVB news, selling out the people of Hong Kong!”
The New York Times fails to mention that opposition media is almost exclusively funded and supported from abroad, particularly out of Washington DC. If Beijing has no say or influence in Hong Kong, territory literally within its own borders, what say does Washington have so many thousands of miles away?
Together, the increasingly disruptive behaviour of the protesters coupled with growing violence and overt endorsement and even support being provided by the United States and other foreign interests, are attempting to target and impact virtually every aspect of life in Hong Kong linked to stability, peace and prosperity.
If the United States cannot maintain Hong Kong as its foothold inside Chinese territory and enjoy the benefits of its prosperity, no one else will either.
Hong Kong is China 
The government of Hong Kong is elected by both the people and organisations representing influential business communities there. The government is overwhelmingly pro-Beijing because Hong Kong is now firmly part of China. It was handed back to China in 1997 by the UK after over 170 years of British subjugation.
An influx of mainlanders, major infrastructure projects and flourishing business between the former British colony and China’s mainland has begun the irreversible re-integration of Hong Kong back into China.
Notions including “Basic Law” and “one country, two systems” were imposed on Beijing which at the time still lacked the political, economic and military power it now possesses. Both Basic Law and the “one country, two systems” arrangement were imposed on Beijing by London specifically as a means of technically handing Hong Kong over, but in practice, maintaining Western influence and the region’s role as Anglo-American foothold within Chinese territory.
As British influence across Asia-Pacific waned over time, Washington took over. Core leaders of Hong Kong’s ongoing protests against Beijing are funded and directed by Washington with many of these leaders, including Martin Lee, Joshua Wong and Benny Tai having literally travelled to Washington to receive support and even awards for their continuously disruptive behaviour.
Beijing has patiently weathered the West’s disruptive activities within its territory. In addition to Hong Kong, the US has nurtured separatism and terrorism in China’s Xinjiang region as well as armed insurrection and separatism in Tibet that has spanned more than half a century.
All of this is part of an admittedly decades-long strategy of encircling and containing China’s rise as a global power in order to preserve American primacy.
China’s answer has been meeting US-backed identity politics designed to divide and destroy, with massive infrastructure, education and economic programmes that have clearly gained the upper-hand even in places like Hong Kong where Western influence has been so deeply entrenched.
When faced with the choice of political instability or infrastructure and economic prosperity, the choice is very simple for the people of not only Hong Kong, but also Xinjiang and Tibet.
It is no wonder residents in Hong Kong have responded negatively to the violence and disruption perpetrated by US-backed protesters. The majority of Hong Kong has nothing to gain from disrupting commerce, targeting infrastructure, blocking roads and the vandalism of public property especially considering why it is really being done.
It is not being done for the people of Hong Kong or the nation of China of which Hong Kong once again now belongs. It is being done for Washington and is just one small part of a much wider, global slash-and-burn foreign policy. The protests in Hong Kong are also part of that policy failing. As US primacy fades across the globe, Washington has resorted to increasingly desperate and spiteful acts of destabilisation, as seen in Hong Kong.
The protests have no future in Hong Kong. They are led by an increasingly unpopular minority backed by a fading global power, and fighting against a growing global colossus within its own borders. The only real question is; how much damage will Washington and its proxies do as they throw this final tantrum?",FAKE
11,Debunking Lies And Myths About The So-Called ‘Soviet-German Pact’ ,"MOSCOW – September 17th marked 80 years since Soviet troops retook western Belarus and western Ukraine, which were previously occupied by Poland. The Polish Army went for a landgrab after the turmoil of WW1, during which Russia lost massive territories. Much later, in 1939, Hitler’s Germany invaded Poland on September 1st, despite the fact that Poland had a pact of “Eternal Friendship” with Hitler. It’s worth noting this pact came in early 1934, that is, mere months after Hitler took power in Germany.
At the time, Nazi Germany was relatively weak militarily. The Wehrmacht was even behind France, Germany’s primary adversary in Western Europe and way behind Russia, which at the time had the most powerful military in the world. By the late 1930s, Poland still held true to its alliance with Hitler, which also included a very favorable trade agreement. That is, favorable for the Third Reich as Germany was getting the much-needed resources from Poland.
The alliance culminated in the joint Polish-German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 (some would call this invasion the real start of the WW2), which was okayed by the UK and France. The capture of Czechoslovakia, which at the time had a highly sophisticated arms industry, gave Hitler the opportunity to almost double the size of his army by mid-1939. But let’s ignore that “trivial fact” and put all the blame on the “evil Russians” which were trying to form an anti-nazi alliance since the moment Hitler took power in 1933. The USSR fought the Nazis during the 1930s, including during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). It was only after multiple British and French refusals to establish an anti-nazi alliance that the Russians have had enough of Western shenanigans and signed the Soviet-German Nonaggression Pact. Now, it should be understood that a nonaggression pact is in no way an alliance, as the rabid Russophobic propaganda would like everyone to think. It’s just what its very name says – a pact in which both parties agree to sign a legally binding document which states they are not to attack each other.
And indeed, seeing how the Wehrmacht ripped through the whole of Europe in mere months, Stalin wanted to avoid a direct confrontation, because he considered the Red Army was still not ready for such a war because the USSR was undergoing a massive military reform which would’ve made the Red Army the most powerful military force in the world by 1942/1943. Hitler knew about this and wanted to invade Russia as soon as possible in order to avoid having to face an even more powerful Russia. The rest is a well-known part of our grim world’s history.
Around 600,000 Soviet soldiers died fighting Nazism and liberating Poland from their murderous oppressors, putting an end to the Nazi killing spree, which stopped at 6 million Polish citizens killed (over 20% of the population). And this Nazi killing spree was stopped only due to the unimaginable war efforts of the Red Army and the USSR, which lost an absolutely staggering 27 million people. And now, those efforts are being denigrated and put on par with the Nazi aggressor. No government system is perfect but despite its many flaws, comparing communism to Nazi oppression and genocide is immoral at best. Still, this is exactly what has been going on for quite some time, and especially in Eastern Europe, which was an area that suffered the most under Nazi rule.
Despite all this, historical revisionism and rabid Russophobia are as rampant as ever. And not just in the traditionally Russophobic countries, like Poland or the Baltic states. Washington (and to a large degree Brussels) are engaged in fostering this hatred so as to not just create a bulwark against the mythical “Russian aggression”, but also a possible staging ground for another “Barbarossa”. Of course, just like in 1938 when they were using Czechs as a bargaining chip, it’s not a big issue for the West to use modern Eastern Europeans as cannon fodder in a possible future confrontation with Russia, leaving the West unscathed. However, this time, it would be quite different as more than 6,000 Russian nukes disagree.",FAKE
12,Even when such was not Poroshenko: Ukraine's economy as the output from the peak,"While the new Ukrainian government is discussing priorities, every minute of leaving the country two citizens. Otgremeli Zelensky first hundred days, all the required destination, and the team of the new president seems to be firmly set to work. And it was known what the priorities set for the Rada. Several of them. Within a month MPs should start discussing and accordingly approve the production of amber, legalized after 10 years of prohibition of gambling business, it has a casino, and, finally, the most controversial bill - is preparing to repeal the moratorium on sale of agricultural land. This ban came in the Ukraine even during the reign of President Leonid Kuchma, in 2001, and still remained extremely painful.
Land in Ukraine - it is now the most valuable and, perhaps, the last interesting asset for investors. Human capacity there is almost no more - all on earnings in Europe, oil and gas there, but the Ukrainian black soil - a very tasty morsel, which for a long time are looking at both European and American monopolies.
The first meeting of the new Cabinet Zelensky and security forces - in stand up comedy and traditional style. An occasion for jokes made the young Premier Alexey Goncharuk.
""I wanted to make a joke about the scooter, but we have a serious meeting,"" - said Zelensky.
""And I wanted to come on a scooter, but also changed his mind,"" - said Alexey Goncharuk.
Then no laughing matter. Zelensky suggests how to bring the country out of the economic peak. It demands to cancel the moratorium on land sales: ""To develop and submit to parliament a draft law on agricultural land market and to abolish the moratorium on land sales.""
Many could not believe their ears. The world's breadbasket Ukraine is ready to abandon his main asset of the highest quality - black earth.
""His attempt to sell the land - a task that put the Ukrainian oligarchy, Kolomoisky,"" - said political analyst Yuri Kot.
The moratorium was acting 14 years. Radical Oleg Lyashko advises farmers to take up pitchforks, because axiom is simple: lack of a ban equal to a total sale of land where the owner is not exactly become ordinary Ukrainian. Even when such was not Poroshenko.
""We have to be either a fool or a criminal, to last the wealth, which remains at the Ukrainian nation, to sell"", - says Oleg Lyashko, leader of the Radical Party of Ukraine.
Apparently, the new Kiev government in a hurry to turn the natural heritage into merchandise and sell Western partners in exchange for another billion from the IMF. But more recently, Zelensky promised to demand renegotiation of lending, and in the movie ""The servant of the people"" and does the IMF sent away for a long time. But one thing - a movie, and the other - the life and the country mired in debt.
""Foreign companies will acquire land. They will be able to get cheap land, will grow oilseed rape, etc. "", - said the head of the Political Economy Research Center, political scientist Vasily Koltashov.
Oppositionist Rabinovich, from the rostrum of Parliament reminds the team Zelensky, which promised maximum transparency to the people, that would be nice to ask the opinion of Ukrainians: ""Before introducing the sale of land, servants of the people should be consulted with the owner, with the Ukrainian people."" It is possible that soon for the sake of the IMF's new government to be auctioned and strategic enterprises - Zelensky has promised to start a large-scale privatizations in 2019. Another anti-crisis solution: legalize the production of amber and turn the country into one big casino.
""We legalize gambling - namely, the casino in five-star hotels,"" - said the Ukrainian president.
All these developments should help the poorest country in Europe, according to the IMF, to revive the economy. In fact it's more like trying to warm up by the stoves, burning an expensive antique furniture.
""What Zelensky promises a miracle, no, it will not. The crisis will make the poor people even more, ""- said the head of the Political Economy Research Center, political scientist Vasily Koltashov.
But even now, according to statistics, every minute of Ukraine leaving two people. Most breaks in Poland, taking by storm the border. They run from the Ukraine in search of a new promised land. As a result, plow, not straightening his back, from sunrise to sunset, but still receive from the pans slap. To understand the scale of the relocation of the Ukrainians in Poland, do not need no dry statistics. Simply go to the center every Polish city and listen to what languages ​​are spoken by the working people: construction workers at numerous construction sites, waiters in restaurants, street barker. In addition to Polish, more often you will hear Russian and Ukrainian speech.
But it seems that the patience of the Poles, where we arrived more than two million migrant workers crowded for a better life. Annoying migrants from the East do not want to take the job, calling ""nedolyudmi"" in supermarkets broadcast signs warning that all Ukrainians waiting for examination at the checkout. However, some supermarket. Ukrainians are usually purchased on the market so-called delay on the outskirts of Warsaw and share their experience, the best way to cook eggplant saute of rotten and what soak rotten meat. But it's flowers. Alena Romanenko from Lutsk worked in the Polish facilities. When her hand tightened in the ironing machine, pan host forbidden rescuers spoil prized possessions. He had cut his hand Alena.
""The pain was terrible. And when rescuers would cut machine, laundry owner said that this can not be done categorically "", - he explained to the victim.
That pans boiling, clear even arrived. A wave of anti-Ukrainian demonstrations covered the Polish cities. Posters - in large letters: ""Ukrainian not my brother."" Organizers of the protests say intruders, agreeing to work for nothing, will soon be left without work Poles themselves.
""Ukrainians too much, and they've really become a problem. Let them go home, ""- said Lukasz Buzhinskiy, member of the organization"" National Radical Camp. ""
From poor neighbors from the East of the Poles and the truth is nothing but trouble. Zarobitchane were being taken to a virus of measles. The epidemic has covered the Ukraine. Now alarming reports of cases - and in the Polish television.
""It is not our measles, she was brought. In Ukraine, 25 thousand cases since the beginning of the year, but because they are moved around the world, ""- says Paul Gzhesevsky, an employee fund"" Institute for the prevention of infectious diseases ""in Poland.
However, its neighbors Ukraine regularly delivers not only viruses - weapons. Belarusian authorities have sounded the alarm.
""We had to close the border with loved ones, completely close the border"", - said President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Criminal chronicles Square full of showdowns with the use of illegal weapons. But there are only small caches, wholesalers do not touch. On a special website has everything from Kalashnikov assault rifles to grenade launchers. With photos, prices. Note: shipping to EU countries. For the inhabitants of Kiev - discount. For example, everyone who buys a weapon - 50 rounds for free. As if shoes or dress you choose. Weapons of ATO zone, almost openly, and driven by volunteers, themselves fighters of the Ukrainian army.
""Today, from 4 to 5 million barrels in the illicit traffic,"" - said Oleg Zhdanov, retired colonel, former officer of the operational management of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces of Ukraine.
In the life of the president Zelensky really everything was much more complicated than in the movies. Legacy of Poroshenko - the cargo is not an easy task. And how to pull the country without a loss, confused over the years all their wealth, even people infested armed to the teeth nationalists, mired in debt, and in fact the peak of payments will have just the presidency Zelensky - do not know, perhaps, no expert.

15,ESTONIA JOINED THE USSR IN COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW,"SUMMARY
We have repeatedly said that there is no, and there was not, a Soviet occupation of Estonia. The country’s entry into the Soviet Union occurred in accordance with the standards of international law.
DISPROOF
This is the part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it tries to promote the idea that there was no Soviet occupation of the Baltic states.
On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) pact whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The Baltic States were not beneficiaries of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Like other countries mentioned in the pact, they lost their independence and territories. Soviet occupation of the Baltic States lasted for 50 years and resulted in mass deportations and repressions against local populations.
24 December 1989, the Parliament of the USSR, the Congress of the People’s Deputies, adopted a resolution, acknowledging the annexation of the Baltic states as a violation of the USSRs obligations. An English translation of the full text here: The Congress notes that during this period the relations of the USSR with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were regulated by a system of treaties. Pursuant to the 1920 Peace Treaties and 1926-1933 Non-Aggression Treaties, the signatories were obliged to honour each other’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability under any circumstances. The Soviet Union had assumed similar obligations to Poland and Finland.

17,AMERICA NEEDS BLOOD IN HONG KONG TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS AGAINST CHINA,"SUMMARY
Protests in Hong Kong are following the Maidan scenario: with the same technologies, crowd management and same hatred of the authorities that is stoked by the Americans. America needs blood and victims in Hong Kong, in order to impose sanctions against China and to weaken it in the ongoing trade war.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory based on a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about protests in Hong Kong and US orchestrating color revolutions. 
The Hong Kong protests began in June 2019 because of a controversial extradition law that would allow for the transfer of suspects to face trial on the Chinese mainland.",REAL
18,UKRAINE SURRENDERS ITS SOVEREIGNTY TO THE EU AND NATO,"SUMMARY
As written in your Constitution, your main aim is to surrender Ukrainian sovereignty to the EU and NATO.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation.
On 21 February 2019, the Law on Strategic Course for the Acquisition of Full Membership of Ukraine in the European Union and NATO entered into force in Ukraine. The amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine defined their strategic aim to join the EU and NATO.
The updated Constitution directs the legislative efforts of deputies to follow European standards. The amendments oblige the Parliament of Ukraine, the Cabinet of Ministers and the President of Ukraine to take necessary actions. These norms also require the President of Ukraine to guarantee the implementation of the policies directed towards its accession to the EU and NATO.
Background:
The pro-Kremlin media has also claimed that the Kyiv-dominated Ukrainian state has been nothing but a puppet regime for Washington, for NATO and to a lesser extent the European Union. In reality neither US, nor the EU countries control Ukraine. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by the free world, except for Russia. Similar narratives are used against other countries too: Germany is the executor of US hegemony over Europe; Lithuania too is not independent and Latvia supposedly has no sovereignty in the EU, no economy, has lost third of its population and it’s foreign policy is dictated by Washington.",REAL
19,UKRAINE IS GOING TO RESTORE PASSENGER LINKS WITH CRIMEA,"SUMMARY
The Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Vladislav Krikliy said in an interview with Radio Liberty that Kyiv decided to restore passenger transport links with the Crimea.
DISPROOF
A deliberate misinterpretation of a statement by a Ukrainian official, recurrent with a popular pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the ""international recognition of the Russian status"" of the occupied Ukrainian peninsula. 
In an interview for Radio Liberty, the Minister of Infrastructure of Ukraine Vladislav Krikliy answered the question whether there will be legal passenger transportation to and from the administrative border with Crimea, as well as a bus station near the control point. The resumption of passenger transport links with Crimea was not discussed.
Later, Minister Krikliy moved to correct the false news, saying that “Ukrainian carriers will carry passengers through Ukraine, exclusively in Ukraine. It’s not about the resumption of any transport links to and from the occupied Crimea.”",REAL
20,EUROPE IS NO LONGER INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
Europe is no longer interested in providing Kyiv with military assistance. The recent actions taken by Brussels show that the EU is willing to restore relations with the Russian Federation.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that the EU and the West, in general, have abandoned Ukraine.
The EU is the biggest foreign donor of Ukraine. Ukraine is the largest recipient of the EU’s macro-financial aid among all non-EU countries. Since 2014, Ukraine has received on average 650 million euros every year from the EU, twice as much as from the United States. Individual EU member-states, primarily Germany, France, and the UK, have also provided financial support to Ukraine. For instance, between 2014 and 2017 Germany contributed a total of €786 million, much of it towards education and post-emergency reconstruction. The United Kingdom provided €105 million, supporting reforms in areas such as peace building, conflict prevention, and public sector management.
The EU and individual EU countries are also main providers of military help to Ukraine. For instance, Germany supported the creation of the Radioactive Waste Disposal Trust Fund. Poland and Lithuania hosted seminars on countering hybrid warfare. Ukraine, Poland, and Lithuania have established a trilateral LITPOLUKRBRIG, a brigade consisting of units from the armies of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine.
It should also be noted that the EU has recently prolonged its sanctions against Russia for further six months, until 15 March 2020. On 3 March 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted the first package of restrictive measures against Russia and condemned its violation of Ukrainian sovereign.",REAL
21,THE CLIMATE MOVEMENT IS DISTRACTING MILLIONS FROM THE REAL THREATS OF HUMAN LIFE ON PLANET EARTH,"SUMMARY
While there is a significant grassroots movement of young activists, the CO2 Climate Consensus has distracted millions of people from an understanding of the broader and ongoing threats to human life on Planet Earth. These climate strikes are taking place at a time of crisis, largely marked by US threats to wage war on Iran. The use of tactical nuclear weapons against Iran is contemplated. Activists are often misled by those who fund the campaign including Rockefeller et al, as well as by the organizers and the public relations operatives involving Hollywood celebrities, et al.
In a bitter irony, the movement against capitalism is funded by capitalism. It’s called “manufactured dissent”.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory, presented without evidence.
Climate change is a scientific fact. Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down rain-forests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming. Preventing dangerous consequences of the climate change is the  key priority for the EU.

23,GRETA THUNBERG “CREATED” AS A TOOL BY CYNICAL ADULTS,"SUMMARY
Greta Thunberg was “created” as a tool by cynical adults, using a special methodology. [She] is a response for the request to panic. This panic has been intensified. But by whom? There is no answer yet. They have successfully found the image of the protest, “the girl with pigtails”, Greta, a fighter for the purity of nature on Earth. They have chosen a teenager with autism. You cannot criticise her since it would be “politically incorrect”, this is a never-failing means of exciting society.
DISPROOF
This claim is a conspiracy presented without any evidence. It is recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about climate change and international youth climate protests started by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.
In August 2018, the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg staged a ""School Strike for Climate"" in front of the Swedish parliament. Later, her strikes inspired youth from all over the world to join a global #FridaysForFuture campaign. The first international school strike was held on Friday, 15 March.
Ever since, Greta Thunberg has been the target of derogatory commentary from pro-Kremlin media. Read our analysis here. Background:
The existence of anthropogenic climate change is a matter of scientific consensus. Only a tiny minority of scientists dispute this consensus: the Earth is warming through the greenhouse effect; human activities - including use of fossil fuels, cutting down rainforests, and farming livestock - are a major cause of the warming; and, unchecked, this rapid warming presents significant risks to human communities and natural systems.
No other environmental threat has been subjected to as much scientific research. The US government has spent billions of dollars on climate science across many agencies and universities. The UN has assembled thousands of scientists to compile and review the latest science and contribute to the publication of five reports since 1990 that have consistently made the consensus deeper and the warnings more urgent. Preventing the dangerous consequences of climate change is a key priority for the EU.

24,KURT VOLKER TORPEDOED MINSK AGREEMENTS FOR FINANCIAL GAIN,"SUMMARY
[Former US Special Representative for Ukraine], Kurt Volker was continuously torpedoing Minsk Agreements, blaming Russia for the aggression, painting Kyiv in favorable light, all for financial gain.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory based on recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the Minsk Agreements and former US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. 
The message aims to obfuscate Russia's responsibility and failure to uphold Minsk Agreements, see similar example: US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt allowed Ukraine ""not to comply with the Minsk agreements"".
As a US special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker supported US decision to provide lethal military aid to Ukraine. According to media reports, Mr. Volker simultaneously held positions with a lobbying firm and a think thank with financial ties to the manufacturer of Javelin anti-tank missile systems. However there is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Volker stood to get financial gain from lack of progress in Minsk Agreements. He has not been accused of violating any conflict-of-interest rules.

The accuracy of the above article ""facts"" agitprop proves that the Ukrainian media supposedly completely ignored the resolution adopted because of ""inconvenient"" for Ukraine, the text of the document.
""Maximum frankly (as implied in the resolution adopted) that the Soviet army - with its four Ukrainian fronts - is an"" occupant "". Millions of Ukrainians (and other nationalities of the Soviet soldiers who fought and died in the war against Nazism) are recognized as invaders, and the very memory of the veneration of the people who saved Europe from Nazism, in fact is a crime "", - emphasized in the article Ukraina.ru. Resolution ""On the European Memory of the importance for the future of Europe,"" the European Parliament has adopted on September 19, but in the field of propaganda, she got only a couple of weeks. Paper focuses not mythical fault of Ukraine for the Second World War, and the very real crimes of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and its successor - Russia.

The document states that MEPs are concerned about the current efforts of the Russian leadership on the whitewash the crimes committed by the Soviet totalitarian regime, and considering them as ""dangerous component of the information war against a democratic Europe.""

32,ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN US ELECTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY INSANE,"SUMMARY
It was simply impossible to “dig up” something that could prove the absolutely insane and naughty allegations of Russian meddling in the internal processes of the US.
DISPROOF
Recurring disinformation narrative claiming that there is no proof of Russian interference in the elections in Western countries and the US - see examples here and here.
The story is the latest link in a chain of denials which Moscow has issued regarding its involvement in the 2016 presidential election in the United States and employs the long-established charge of Russophobia which the Kremlin uses to deflect criticism, however legitimate.
Before the Mueller report was published, Russian meddling in the 2016 election had already been established by US intelligence agencies. Thus, the Special Investigation was primarily concerned with ""whether any Americans […] joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election"" (p.2).
The report explicitly identifies ""numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"" (p. 9). A number of these individuals later ""made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct"" the probe (p. 180). The report's conclusions, therefore, do nothing to absolve the Russian government. Further debunk here.",REAL

But how they’ve gone about it, may require to determine – whether overtly or de facto – whether Russia’s control over Crimea is illegal. [—]
This places Ukraine’s claims in danger of being rejected outright, de-legitimising their claim, and perhaps even creating the de facto precedent that an international body with standing among the parties, such as is the ECHR, treated the Russian control of Crimea as a legal (or, perhaps, ‘not illegal’) phenomenon.

The IMF mission summed up the disappointing results of two-weeks work in Ukraine. The new IMF lending program to Ukraine has not yet been approved, because no one in the world, especially in the rotting capitalist West, wants to lend to the Ukrainian government. The official reasons for refusing a three-year loan are corruption, oligarchs and low economic growth rates.
DISPROOF
A recurring disinformation narrative the West and Ukraine.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission visited Kyiv during 12-26 September, to hold discussions for the 2019 Article IV consultation with Ukraine. The mission also initiated discussions on a new programme that could be supported under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
According to the official press release, while the IMF acknowledges Ukraine's shortcomings in the legal framework, pervasive corruption, and that large parts of the economy dominated by inefficient state-owned enterprises or by oligarchs, it still appreciated the progress made so far in setting up new institutions to fight corruption. The new programme was not rejected and is still being discussed before the final decision is taken.  
""The mission has had productive discussions on policies for a new programme, especially on fiscal and monetary policies, as well as key reform measures. It also underscored the importance of central bank independence and safeguarding financial stability, as well as the need to make every effort to minimise the fiscal costs of bank resolutions.

36,UKRAINE NEVER FULFILLED MINSK AGREEMENTS,"SUMMARY
Ukraine promised to fulfil this plan a thousand and one times and never fulfilled it. The failure to fulfil this plan is extremely unpleasant for Germany because a lot of German authority was put into it.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Minsk agreements, portraying Ukraine as the only violator of the ceasefire.
In March 2015, the European Council linked the duration of EU sanctions on Russia to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, acknowledging Russia's responsibility to uphold the agreements. The EU has condemned systematic restrictions to the freedom of movement of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM), by Russia-backed armed formations in southern Donetsk and non-government-controlled areas along the Russian border. ""Restrictions of the SMM’s access continued, including at a checkpoint near Kreminets, where members of the armed formations behaved aggressively towards the Mission.""
Overview of the implementation of the Minsk II agreement shows that both parts did not fulfil the plan. The analysis of the Atlantic Council shows that the majority of violations can be attributed to Russia-backed armed formations.
France and Germany expressed the regret on selective interpretation of the Minsk agreements by Russia. In a joint press conference to the United Nations, the ambassadors of France and Germany stated that there's an urgent need to ""a renewed commitment by Russia and all sides to the Minsk Agreements and the Normandy Process.”",REAL
37,RUSSIA SAVED SYRIA AS A COUNTRY,"SUMMARY
In the four years since the presence of Russian air forces in Syria, much has been achieved, but most importantly, Syria was saved as a country.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Syrian war.
In fact, Russia saved a leader, not a nation. There is ample evidence that the Syrian leadership (supported by Russia) is responsible for numerous massacres, bombings and chemical attacks on civilians in Syria. Russian airstrikes on hospitals, water treatment plants and mosques [causing hundreds of civilian deaths] have also been documented. Both militaries have denied the allegation. Amnesty International has also gathered evidence, including photos and video footage, suggesting the Russians have used unguided bombs in densely populated civilian areas, as well as internationally banned deadly cluster munitions.
Moreover, pro-Kremlin media often refer to Russian military intervention in Syria as a “war on terrorism” aimed at destroying Daesh. In reality,  Russia’s military action has mostly concentrated on targeting the non-Daesh opposition forces, while a relatively low proportion of Russian airstrikes in Syria have targeted Daesh or other al-Qaeda-linked groups.

39,THE RESOLUTION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SHOWS THAT EUROPE HAS BECOME INSOLENT,"SUMMARY
The resolution of the European Parliament, which equates the Soviet Union with Nazi Germany, shows that Europe has become insolent.
Europe keeps forgetting the signing of the Munich agreement between Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and France in 1938. Also, before the beginning of the World War II, the non-aggression pact with Germany was signed by England, France, Lithuania, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia, but it seems that such an agreement existed only between Germany and the USSR.
DISPROOF
This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by stating that other European countries signed various international agreements with Germany after 1934. See other examples referring to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact here, here and here.
It is a proven historical fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact directly caused the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in complete occupation of this country by Germany and USSR.
On 18 September, the European Parliament adopted a resolution, describing the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 23 August 1939 as a key element, causing World War II:
The Second World War, the most devastating war in Europe’s history, was started as an immediate result of the notorious Nazi-Soviet Treaty on Non-Aggression of 23 August 1939, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and its secret protocols, whereby two totalitarian regimes that shared the goal of world conquest divided Europe into two zones of influence.

81 years ago, the Wehrmacht invaded Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia as a result of the Munich Agreement signed the previous evening. If the reasons for the Second World War are to be commemorated in the EU today, it would be better to delete the reference to it, as in the controversial resolution of the EU Parliament – unlike the Hitler-Stalin Pact.
Such a policy had unfortunately been pursued so far and threatened to trigger the fourth great war, despite the written offers of the Soviet Union to France and Czechoslovakia.
The Soviet proposals were practically ignored. They had been accepted indifferently, if not contemptuously […] The events took place as if there had been no Soviet Russia. Then we had to pay dearly for it.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about WWII.
The Munich Agreement (September 30, 1938), indeed, permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland, in western Czechoslovakia. The policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler was heavily criticised in Europe and proved to be a disastrous move. World War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Great Britain and France responded by declaring war on Germany on 3 September.
Before Germany attacked Poland, Hitler and Stalin signed a non-aggression pact, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (23 August 1939). The deal was accompanied by a secret supplementary protocol on the delimitation of areas of mutual interest in Eastern Europe. In particular, Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland. The agreement also indicated that the Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, as well as Bessarabia and Finland, belonged to the respective areas of interest of Germany and the USSR.
The Soviet Union attacked Poland on September 17, forcing the Polish army to fight on two fronts. Poland was divided according to the agreements of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. The USSR later attacked Finland and annexed the Baltic states, all along the agreements with Nazi Germany.

41,THE CHANGE OF THE SITUATION IN DONBAS DEPENDS SOLELY ON KYIV,"SUMMARY
The normalisation of relations with Russia is determined by the implementation of the Minsk agreements, but here everything is very complicated. (…) The change of the situation in Donbas depends solely on Kyiv. Therefore, the conditions imposed on Russia are practically unattainable.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine and the Minsk agreements, portraying Ukraine as the primary violator of the cease-fire.
The change of the situation in Donbas depends not only on Ukraine, but also on Russia. There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The EU has condemned the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.
Former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, stated that the final fulfillment of the Minsk agreements is dependent on Russia’s decision to withdraw its forces from the occupied territories. “Unfortunately, the problem with the Minsk implementation is Russia’s continued occupation of Eastern Ukraine and the ongoing fighting there, so it’s impossible for Ukraine to go any further than it already has,” Volker said. According to Volker, Russia still has to fully implement a ceasefire deal, to withdraw its forces, and to disband the so-called People’s Republics in Donbas.
According to the latest reports by the OSCE Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, there are violations of the Minsk agreement on both sides of the conflict.
The analysis of the Atlantic Council shows, that the majority of violations can be attributed to Russia-backed armed formations.

42,NATO INCREASES ITS PRESENCE ON THE WESTERN BORDER OF MOLDOVA TO INTIMIDATE RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
A new military reality is being formed on the western borders of Moldova. NATO is constantly increasing its strength and armaments, creates secret special forces bases and conducts large-scale exercises on the borders with Russia. The goal of these actions is obvious – to intimidate Russia.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring conspiracy about NATO's presence in Romania. It also induces the idea that this would have a negative impact on Moldova. The article also contains a pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the West's encirclement of Russia. 
Cooperation between the Republic of Moldova and NATO is based on respect for Moldova’s constitutional neutrality. The main focus of this cooperation is to support the country’s efforts to reform and modernise its defence and security structures and institutions.
NATO is not encircling Russia. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, less than one-sixteenth (1,215 kilometres), is shared with NATO members. Russia has land borders with 14 countries. Only five of them are NATO members.

43,EUROPE TODAY HAS AN IMPORTANT TASK TO SETTLE THE CIVIL WAR IN UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
Europe today faces very important task related to the settlement of the civil war in Ukraine. And creation of a new European security architecture.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, attempting to portray it as a civil war. By claiming that Europe has to settle the war in Ukraine, the Russian side is trying to divert attention from its own responsibility for provoking the war in Ukraine. It disregards the extensive factual evidence confirming ongoing Russian military presence in Donbas. Prior debunks of this narrative can be found here and here.
The war in Ukraine is supported by Russian Federation armed forces, it is not a civil war. Overwhelming evidence confirms that Russia is sending mercenaries to Donbas. The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"", and continue to condemn the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.",REAL
44,RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE WEST DETERIORATED DUE TO CIVIL WAR IN UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
The formal reason for the sharp deterioration in relations between Russia and the West was the situation around Ukraine, where, after the 2014 coup, a civil war broke out. Kyiv has repeatedly accused Moscow of allegedly participating in a conflict in the east of the country. However, the Russian Federation has consistently emphasised the groundlessness of such rhetoric, since Russia is not a subject, but a guarantor of the Minsk agreements, the task of which is to resolve the conflict in the Donbas.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, and Euromaidan protests. It was not Ukraine, but Russia which illegally annexed Crimea and continues violating Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. This led to sanctions and a deterioration in relations between Russia and other countries.
The onset of the Euromaidan protests which began in Kyiv in November 2013 – called ""Maidan"", or ""Euromaidan"" – were  a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with former President Yanukovych's last minute U-turn when, after seven years of negotiation, he refused to sign the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement and halted progress towards Ukraine's closer relationship with the EU as a result of Russian pressure. The protesters' demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence. See some more recent debunks of this claim here and here. See a similar case denying Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Eastern Ukraine here.
The EU and the US have condemned the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.",REAL
45,RUSSO-GEORGIAN WAR WAS A WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE,"SUMMARY
Russia recognized 11 years ago the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which had been part of the former Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia and were seeking independence even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union. This occurred after a five-day war between Georgia and South Ossetia in August 2008, which killed 1,692 people and injured about 1,500 civilians in South Ossetia.
In addition to Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Nauru also recognized the independence of Abkhazia. Syria announced the recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia on May 29, 2018.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative trying to deny any role for Russia in the Russo-Georgian 2008 war, and presenting it instead as a conflict between South Ossetia and Georgia. South Ossetia and Abkhazia did not claim independence from Georgia, but were occupied by Russia.
Russia continues its military presence in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia in violation of international law and commitments undertaken by Russia under the 12 August 2008 agreement, mediated by the European Union.
Many international organisations condemned Russian occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, see e.g. the CSCE statements and European Parliament's declaration.",REAL

49,POLAND WANTS TO DIVIDE EUROPE INTO TWO CAMPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS LEADERSHIP WITHIN EUROPE,"SUMMARY
Poland might divide NATO and Europe into two camps in the near future. Poland says that its energy security is provided not by Germany or France, but  by the US. They want to buy American liquefied natural gas even though it is more expensive than Russian gas. Because of political reasons, Poland is going to divide Europe to carry out its plans and strengthen its dominant role in Europe.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory perpetuating a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about russophobic Poland and the US presence in Europe.
Poland and the Baltic States are often accused by the pro-Kremlin media of obeying the USA in order to counter Western Europe.
Similar disinformation cases can be seen here and here.",REAL
50,THE MOLOTOV-RIBBENTROP PACT IS NOT AN “UNUSUAL” DOCUMENT,"SUMMARY
For some reason, there is an impression that the non-aggression pact was signed only between Germany and the USSR. Before the outbreak of WWII, the UK, France, Lithuania, Latvia, Denmark, and Estonia signed non-aggression pacts with Germany.
DISPROOF
This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to erode the disastrous historical role of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact by the statements that other European countries signed various international agreements with Germany after Adolf Hitler came into power. See other examples referring to the Molotov-Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact here, here and here.
First of all, it is impossible to compare the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with various agreements signed between Germany and other European countries throughout the 1930s. There is no historical evidence that these agreements contained any secret protocols, which assumed common aggressive actions of Germany and these countries against third parties.
In the case of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it is a proven historical fact that it contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact directly caused the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in complete occupation of Poland by Germany and USSR.",REAL
51,THE PUBLIC OPINION IS TURNING FROM POLITICALLY CORRECT LIBERAL IDEOLOGY TO MENTAL ILLNESS,"SUMMARY
The rise in activities against the Russian threat is directly connected to drafting the new Norwegian defence budget.
Facts are not noticed even when Moscow is waving them under the nose, this happened with the witnesses of the Douma fake gas attack who were brought to Hague.
The situation is becoming worse as the public opinion is turning from politically correct liberal ideology to becoming mentally ill.
DISPROOF
Regarding the draft defence budget, its actually exactly the opposite - European countries have been increasing their defence spending after the acts of aggression by Russian  military forces in Ukraine.
The claim is probably a reference to Russia bringing witnesses to a meeting at OPCW. ""Russia has been accused of carrying out an “obscene masquerade” for transporting 17 Syrian people to Europe to assert that no chemical weapons attack occurred in the town of Douma earlier this month,"" The Guardian reports. Numerous countries called for an end to such unacceptable Russian defamation of the OPCW. They also called the so-called information meeting at OPCW headquarters that Russia held 'nothing more than a crude propaganda exercise'. See similar cases here. 
Claims about public opinion are similar to other examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation about the moral decay of Europe. ""Threatened values"" is one of the most common narratives used by pro-Kremlin outlets. See also earlier cases alleging that in contrast to Russia, western Europe is abandoning Christian roots and that unlike Russia, the West is not about fairness or solidarity and it degrades traditional values and endangers societies. Furthermore, all-Russian history is highly moral as opposed to the Western one, which is full of violence and evil, and all high-ranking politicians in the Baltic states are likely implicated in paedophilia.",REAL

53,THE USA PERSISTENTLY IMPOSES CONFRONTATION WITH RUSSIA ON EUROPE,"SUMMARY
European countries, NATO members and neutral (countries) do not have a sovereign right to formulate their military policies and strategies in relations with Russia. If they still have some chance for manoeuvre in their foreign policy, in military policy they remain led by the US. The US persistently imposes confrontation with Russia on Europe.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about US presence in Europe, portraying Europe as a vassal of the USA and trying to undermine the sovereignty of the West. Russian disinformation sources like to claim that almost all European countries are no longer truly sovereign and the United States dictates policies to the EU and its member states.
The EU Member States are sovereign countries and make sovereign decisions about their own security and policies. Possible NATO/ US military presence and support in the EU Member States is possible only on the basis of the clear request/ consent of the hosting nation. The US is an important ally to the EU but EU policy is not determined by the US, as explained by the EU High Representative.
The US does not impose a confrontation with Russia. EU countries, make sovereign decisions to host NATO/US military forces on their land. NATO membership is open to any European state in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area. All NATO members have made sovereign decisions to join the alliance. NATO decisions are made by consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries.

No evidence given. A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on the Russophobia in the Baltic States and in Ukraine.
In fact, Ukraine is not a Russophobic country as is often claimed by the Kremlin media. It had to react to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the act of aggression by the Russian armed forces in Donbas. It did not ban the Russian language, as is often claimed by the Kremlin, nor did it ban contact between Ukrainians and Russians.

55,"THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN SYRIA
","SUMMARY
Chemical weapon, sanctions, this and that, everything is staged. The last bloc of sanctions is a sort of comedy. They were imposed because Russia allegedly did not stand against the use of chemical weapons in Syria. But there is not a single piece of evidence of any chemical attacks in Syria. All these [proofs of the] chemical attacks, all these white helmets… failed.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on the lack of proof of the chemical attacks in Syria, discrediting White Helmets and criticising sanctions against Russia.
The chemical weapon attacks in Syria were confirmed by the OPCW, the international organisation which conducts probes into all allegations of chemical weapons' use in Syria; its findings serve as the basis for publicly available reports and expert notes. See more details here.
The White Helmets are a volunteer search and rescue organisation made up of a group of Syrian civilians who mobilised to help war casualties in Syria, namely injured civilians trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings. The organisation - which is made up of 3,400 volunteers including teachers, engineers, tailors and firefighters - states that it has no affiliation to any political or military actor and is committed to render services to anyone in need.  
The EU imposed sanctions over the use of chemical weapons for the first time in history in January 2019, targeting four Russians over the Skripal poisoning in Salisbury UK, and five Syrians and one entity over chemical attacks in Douma in April 2018.

56,"THE JIT MH17 INVESTIGATION WAS ONE-SIDED, WITHOUT THE PARTICIPATION OF RUSSIA","SUMMARY
Initially the media made the main contribution to the formation of an opinion about the “fault” of Russia for the tragedy of MH17.
When the plane crashed, the West, at the initiative of Ukraine, immediately blamed Russia for this. The investigation was one-sided, without the participation of the Russian side.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the MH17 crash.
First of all, Russia's interest in aiding the JIT investigation is not a relevant condition to its membership in JIT. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke told a Russian newspaper that ""if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.""
A special team, known as the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. JIT investigation and conclusions are not based just on Media publications.
The JIT has published an online magazine about the criminal investigation into the crash of flight MH17. It contains information about how the investigation is being conducted. The purpose of the criminal investigation is to establish the facts of the case; determine the truth of what happened; identify those responsible for downing flight MH17; and gather criminal evidence for prosecution. Actually, the JIT has indeed provided concrete evidence of Russia's involvement.
The JIT conclusions were further corroborated by Bellingcat.

57,NORWAY CARRIES OUT AN AGGRESSIVE ANTI-RUSSIAN INFORMATION CAMPAIGN,"SUMMARY
Recently, Norway carries out systematic work to propagate the image of Russia as an enemy. It is an aggressive anti-Russian policy based on provocative fakes.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on Russophobia and anti-Russian moods in the Western countries.
No evidence given to back up  the claims of “an aggressive anti-Russian policy based on provocative fakes”. Relations between Norway and Russian have deteriorated since 2014 when Norway joined other European countries in implementing anti-Russian sanctions following the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. Since then, the countries exchanged several mutual accusations of spying. Thus, in April 2019, a Russian court sentenced Norwegian Frode Berg to 14 years in a strict-regime labour camp for spying on Russian navy submarines.
In May 2019, Norwegians discovered a beluga whale wearing a harness indicating its Russian origin. One of the speculations was that the whale had escaped from a Russian military facility and was spying in Norwegian waters. However, no one from Russia publicly admitted the whale’s origin.

58,HOMOSEXUAL AND LESBIAN VALUES LEAD TO MORAL DECLINE,"SUMMARY
Today the borderlines of good family relations blur. However, they have always been preserved by the church. Nowadays we are told: there is no mother, no farther, but only parent one and parent two. They promote homosexual and lesbian values. It is so scary, it is a real enmity against God. Afterwards they stay in the condition of moral decline. It is frightening to watch those who live in such a dissolute and licentious way.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about threatened values,which is used to undermine progressive Western attitudes about a variety of normative issues, including the rights of women, ethnic and religious minorities, and LGBTQ groups, among others.
As stated by Human Rights Watch, most regimes which suppress democratic values fight against LGBT rights. As of September 2019, there are 29 countries which perform and 2 more (Israel and Mexico) which recognise the legality of same sex marriages. Many churches all over the world welcome people who identify themselves as LGBT community (see an example here).",REAL
59,THE WAR IN DONBAS BEGAN AFTER UKRAINE BANNED THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE,"SUMMARY
The war in Donbas has started after Ukraine had abolished the law on regional languages. Many forget about this. The Russians in Ukraine remain Russians, but Ukraine banned education in the Russian language, prohibited children from learning Russian. This is the reason why the conflict in Donbas started. This was the reason for what has happened in both Donbas and Crimea.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine.
The international community, including the European Union recognizes and condemns clear violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014. 
The law on regional languages was repealed by the parliament of Ukraine on February 23, 2014. However the decree was not signed. The law officially expired only on February 28, 2018, when the Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared the law unconstitutional.

60,UKRAINIAN BIOMETRIC PASSPORTS WERE INTRODUCED TO “CUT OFF” RESIDENTS OF UNCONTROLLED TERRITORIES,"SUMMARY
Ukrainian biometric passports were introduced under Petro Poroshenko in 2017, to “cut off” the residents of uncontrolled territories.
DISPROOF
This case is consistent with recurring disinformation narratives about Ukrainian statehood and human rights violations in Ukraine primarily targeting those living in the east. The claim that biometric passports were introduced as a punitive measure against residents in eastern Ukraine is unsupported by any evidence.
As stated by the State Migration Service of Ukraine, biometric documents are well protected from forgery and exclude the possibility of their use by any person other than the owner. The main idea behind the implementation is to significantly increase the security of society against crime and international terrorism.
The rules for issuing biometric documents (passport for travelling abroad and an ID passport) are the same for all citizens of Ukraine and are approved by resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on March 25, 2015 №302 (for the ID passport) and May 7, 2014 №152 (for the passport for traveling abroad).
According to the Law of Ukraine, from July 14, 2016 No. 1474-VIII ""On Amending Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine Concerning Documents Confirming Citizenship of Ukraine, Identifying Persons or Their Special Status"", aimed at Visa Liberalisation with the European Union, the issuance of passports in the form of cards was introduced to all citizens from October 1, 2016.

In addition, the Muller investigation on Trump’s links to the Kremlin gave no results and now they intend to find the compromising evidence proving this claim.
Also, Norwegian media claims that Russian agents operated on Spitsbergen as well as on the mainland. Thus, the patriotic collection of amazing fantasies code-named “Russians are coming!” was complemented with another exhibit of “Special forces in civilian clothes.”
This means that the phenomenon of the “Russian threat”, “Russian trace”, and “Kremlin hands” is becoming weirder and unhealthy in world politics.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on Russophobia. The article is a response to Aldimer's recent publication claimed that Russian tactical action groups have been operating on Norwegian soil.
The article contains two disinformation narratives:
""The Russians are coming. They’re right around. I’ve seen Russian soldiers” – these words were attributed to James Forrestal by Soviet propaganda. Shortly after the suicide in 1949, Soviet broadsheet newspaper Pravda published a cartoon depicting the ""Russophobe” U.S. Secretary of Defence. The investigation report on Forrestal's death notes that ""the late James V. Forrestal died as a result of injuries, multiple, extreme, received incident to a fall from a high point in the tower, building one, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland.” Not a single witness has noted that during his stay at the Naval Hospital James Forrestal was mentioning ""Russians.” Not a single witness has noted that they witnessed the moment when Forrestal jumped down shouting ""the Russians are coming”. More debunking by Myth Detector here.
Recurring disinformation narrative about Mueller's investigation and alleged lack of its results. In fact, the Mueller's report explicitly identifies ""numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"" (p. 9). A number of these individuals later ""made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct"" the probe (p. 180).

64,THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT PROVOKED THE WAR IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
The Ukrainian regime provoked the war in the Donbas region after its people rebelled against the coup in Kiev in 2014, which brought extremists with hostile feelings towards Russia to power in Ukraine.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the war in Ukraine. It was Russia that provoked a war in Ukraine, and not the Ukrainian government. There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.
Furthermore, according to the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Russian special forces and troops operated to mobilise, lead, equip, and support separatist militias in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine from spring 2014 to the present, although their presence was denied by Moscow. Overwhelming evidence confirms that Russia participates in the conflict with Ukraine sending mercenaries to Donbas.
In an interview, delivered in autumn 2018, former First Deputy Chief Monitor to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine Alexander Hug mentions that the Mission has been recording the instances of Russia's involvement into the war in Donbas. ""We have been seeing at least in six instances convoys leaving and entering Ukraine, which we have been documenting, which have been driving towards the unsecure border with the Russian Federation in the middle of the night, on dirt roads, and have been seen at the unsecure border at areas where there is no official border crossing,"" Hug said.

And then the US burst the bomb and announced that the Aegis system could be used to launch these medium-range missiles. At least they could take a longer break, after the withdrawal from the INF Treaty.
It is clear that Russia was deceived. The US tried to deceive us, and now the US just admitted it.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about missile defence systems. The US did not lie to Russia, therefore Russia was not deceived.
The Aegis missile defence system (Aegis Ashore Ballistic Missile Defence System) was not, and is not, in violation of the INF Treaty. The US State Department issued a detailed rebuttal of Russian allegations of US noncompliance with the INF Treaty in 2018.
According to the U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (2016): the Aegis Ashore Missile Defence System is part of the European Phased Adapted Approach, designed to protect European NATO allies, and U.S. deployed forces in the region, against current and emerging ballistic threats from the Middle East. U.S. Naval Forces ruled out the possibility of targeting the Russian Federation with the ""Aegis Ashore"" system.
The Romanian Defence Minister Teodor Melescanu also reiterated on 7 February 2019 that ""Aegis Ashore"" is a strictly defensive system.
The missile defence stations, also known as ""Aegis Ashore"", are technically based on the Mk41 launchers (in accordance with the INF Treaty) used on ships, which can also launch cruise missiles. According to the US government they are modified that they can only launch defence missiles and not offensive ground-to-ground missiles, concludes the Research Services of the German Bundestag in 2018 (P.2, in German).",REAL
66,"WHITE HELMETS FAKED THE 2017 KHAN SHEIKHOUN CHEMICAL ATTACK
","SUMMARY
RT was granted exclusive access to an underground fortress in Khan Sheikhoun, a former terrorist stronghold. According to the Syrian Army, the underground complex doubled as a film set which the White Helmets used to record footage of a fake chemical attack in 2017.
Back then, blame for the incident, which has never been definitively settled, was pinned on Damascus, and the White Helmet videos became a pretext for a missile strike on Syria by the US and its allies.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narratives aiming to discredit the White Helmets and claiming that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack was staged by Western actors in order to justify military action against the Assad regime.
The OPCW’s Fact Finding Mission confirmed that people in Khan Shaykhun were exposed to sarin, a chemical weapon, on 4 April 2017. “The OPCW FFM has confirmed the use of sarin, a nerve agent, during the 4 April incident in Khan Shaykhun in Syria,” mentioned its Director-General in a report published on June 30, 2017.
The UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism found Syria’s Government responsible for the attack in Khan Shaykhun. On April 10 2018, Russia vetoed a U.S.-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution that would have created a new inquiry to ascertain responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In June, the OPCW members granted it power to assign blame for chemical attacks.
The United Nations Human Rights Council blamed the Syrian government forces for the attack. “Government forces continued to deliberately target civilians, including through the use of chemical weapons against civilians in opposition-held areas. As part of an aerial campaign in northern Hama and southern Idlib, on 4 April the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Shaykhun, killing over 80 people, most of whom were women and children,” says the report.

67,RUSSIA DIDN’T HOLD NUCLEAR WAR EXERCISE AGAINST SWEDEN,"SUMMARY
Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, scared the world with “information” that Russia held an exercise where troops trained for nuclear war with Sweden in 2013.
DISPROOF
The Russians actually did train attacks against Sweden: two heavy Tu-22M3 bombers with four jet fighter escorts were simulating attacks against Stockholm. The incident caused controversy in Sweden at the time because the Swedish military was caught unprepared and had to rely on Danish airforce jets, operating as part of a NATO’s Baltic air policing mission, to respond and follow the Russian aircraft.",REAL

74,"IN UKRAINE, SCHOOLS WILL BE CLOSED IN LARGE NUMBERS","SUMMARY
The Ministry of Education of Ukraine is going to close schools in large numbers and limit the teaching in Russian language. A new wave of liquidation of schools will lead to an increase in the number of uneducated people in Ukraine.
DISPROOF
No evidence provided. This is another pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the new Ukrainian law “on ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language” and “on education”, which provides for the transition of all educational institutions of Ukraine to Ukrainian - the state language - as language of teaching.
No one is planning to close schools in Ukraine. As of September 2020, those schools which teach in Russian will be transferred to the teaching system in the state language - Ukrainian. In schools with teaching languages that belong to the languages of the European Union, this system will be introduced in September 2023. However, representatives of national minorities in Ukraine, in any case, maintain the right to study their native language.
Neither of the laws limits the right of national minorities to communication, education, the conduction of various events and to release information products in their native language (video from 08.45).

75,THE MAIN ACTIVITY OF THE LATVIAN STATE IS THE TRADE OF RUSSOPHOBIA,"SUMMARY
Latvian sprat companies struggle because of the Russian counter-sanctions. Even the Latvian state is not able to help them. In fact, the Latvian state’s main activity is the trade of Russophobia.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on Russophobia in the Baltic States and, in particular, in Latvia. See similar cases here.
Such disinformation narratives are often combined with criticism on the sanctions against Russia which followed the annexation of Crimea and conflict in Eastern Ukraine and attempts to prove that EU countries suffer more from the sanctions imposed by Russia in return, as in this case.
Most research support the view that sanctions, imposed on Russia by the US and EU following the annexation of Crimea and Russian meddling in the US election, were an effective tool. The Russian economy has been performing worse under sanctions. In 2014, Russian GDP growth was as low as 0.7%. As proved by World Bank data, it decreased by 2,3% in 2015 and had a modest revival afterwards with 0.3%, 1.6% and 2.3% of growth during 2016-2018. In contrast, during the same period, the EU's economy did not experience recession and had an annual GDP growth of between 1.8% and 2.5%.
Latvia’s full-year GDP growth in 2019 is forecast to slow to 3.0% according to the European Economic Forecast of Summer 2019 while the Russian economy has forecast growth of 1.2% in 2019, according to the World Bank in its Russia Economic Report.

76,RUSSIA DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE WAR IN THE DONBAS AND DOES NOT TAKE PRISONERS,"SUMMARY
Russia does not capture Ukrainians, because the Russian military does not take part in hostilities in the Donbas. The Minsk agreements do not state that Russia is at war with somebody.
DISPROOF
This is one of the most common disinformation narratives; that Russia has nothing to do with the war in eastern Ukraine and that there is a “civil war” in Donbas. Read more cases on this narrative here.
There is no exact data on the number of Ukrainians arrested by Russia in the occupied parts of Donbas and in the annexed Crimea. The problem is that Russia and the separatists do not recognise such people as prisoners and qualify their actions as crimes, for example, the now liberated Crimean Oleh Sentsov, who was accused by Russia of ""preparing a terrorist act"" and illegally sentenced to imprisonment.
According to the Security Service of Ukraine, 227 Ukrainians are still illegally detained in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In addition, another 113 people are illegally detained in Russia and the annexed Crimea, 89 of them are Crimean Tatars. Since 2014, 3,280 Ukrainians have been liberated from Russian prisons and from the occupied territories of Ukraine.",REAL
77,UKRAINE WILL FIGHT WITH DONBAS AND KILL ITS PEOPLE,"SUMMARY
Today, Ukraine demonstrates its barbarism, in contrast to the civilised Kyrgyzstan. It is not going to sit down and negotiate with the regions that have not accepted the results of the Maidan, rather it is going to fight with them, that is, to kill. Even Zelenskyy speaks of the return of the territories, but he does not speak of people.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Kyiv government sabotaging peace in the Donbas region. See previous cases about the Minsk agreements and the war in Ukraine.
It is Russia which continues violating Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity since February 2014. In March 2014, in the absence of de-escalatory steps by Russia, the European Council imposed the first travel bans and asset freezes against persons involved in actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity. In July 2014, in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in eastern Ukraine, the EU imposed economic sanctions in July 2014 and reinforced them in September 2014. In March 2015, the European Council linked the duration of EU sanctions on Russia to the complete implementation of the Minsk agreements, acknowledging Russia's responsibility to uphold the Agreements. See here for an overview of EU restrictive measures in response to the crisis in Ukraine.
U.S. former Special Representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, stated that the final fulfillment of the Minsk agreements is dependent on Russia’s decision to withdraw its forces from the occupied territories. “Unfortunately, the problem with Minsk implementation is Russia’s continued occupation of Eastern Ukraine and the ongoing fighting there, so it’s impossible for Ukraine to go any further than it already has”, Volker said. According to Volker, Russia still has to fully implement a ceasefire deal, to withdraw its forces, and to disband the so-called people’s Republics in the Donbas region.
The latest reports by the OSCE Monitoring Mission to Ukraine inform that there are violations of the Minsk agreement on both sides of the conflict. However, the analysis of the Atlantic Council shows that the majority of violations can be attributed to Russia-backed armed formations. For instance, separatists of the self-proclaimed DNR and LNR violated the Minsk agreements with the so-called elections organised there in February 2018 as one of the examples.",REAL
78,"UKRAINE IS AN INSTRUMENT OF PRESSURE ON RUSSIA, ITS NEEDS TO BE A COUNTRY AT WAR","SUMMARY
Ukraine is not really a barbaric country. The country has turned barbaric by people who use the country as an instrument of pressure on Russia. They know and knew how to solve the problem of Donbas, how to change the Constitution. There are quite serious lawyers there. But since Ukraine needs to be a country at war, it will not be allowed to do anything of this. It is an object of geopolitics.

Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Ukrainian statehood, the war in Ukraine, and Russophobia as well.
Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world. The EU and the US work closely with Ukraine. Their relations are not oriented against Russia.

Since 2020, 7-9 th grades of these schools 80% of subjects should be in Latvian, and from 2021 in the senior high school and almost all of the educational process should be the official language. Minorities can study in their native language only their native language and literature, as well as objects related to culture and history. It is against this reform, people go to rallies, calling the changes ""fascist."" It is noteworthy that every time in Riga held rallies, organized protest advocated organization ""Russian Union of Latvia"", which is headed by Tatiana Zhdanok. In Latvia, it has a reputation, repeatedly popadaashego in political scandals linked to the Kremlin. In May 2018 the country's National Security Service initiated a criminal case due to ""rd Latvian parents' meeting"" aimed against the transfer of schools to the Latvian language of instruction. Special services of Latvia was then informed that the event, which is organized Zhdanok was ""a crime against the state.""
Another criminal case against Tatiana Zhdanok opened in March this year for inciting ethnic hatred. Then the head of the pro-Russian organizations during the hearings in the European Parliament ""Political Persecution in the Baltic States"" has compared the so-called ""discrimination"" of modern Russian in Latvia with the genocide of the Jewish people during the Second World War. However, the loudest scandal involving Zhdanok, occurred in 2015. Then the Latvian media have published an investigation, according to which the two organizations, which is headed by the pro-Russian activist, financed from the Fund for the support and protection of the rights of compatriots. The fund created in 2012 the president of Russia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in charge of his personal Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. According to the investigation, but in 2014 another project Zhdanok - Latvian Human Rights Committee (LKPCH) - has received from the Russian government more than 94 thousand euros. Further, the money from LKPCH diverted to the fund ""Russian Union of Latvia"", which is organizing the pro-Russian rallies and events in the country. Even if you discard a clear link between the demonstrations in Riga and the Russian government, the narrative of ""infringement of the Russian-speaking"" in Latvia still remains unlikely. Back in 2012, when the ""language"" theme at its peak, was one of the largest in the country's referendum on granting Russian a second state language. Then it voted about 70% of the population with the right to vote - more than a million people, of which more than 800,000 have chosen the Latvian language only state. By the way, one of the main initiators of the referendum was the leader of a society ""Native language"" Vladimir Linderman, whose security services are also suspected of funding from the Kremlin. Against him and several criminal cases, including those for anti-state activities.",REAL
96,"UKRAINE IS A STATE FORMATION, NOT A COUNTRY","SUMMARY
It is hard to name Ukraine a country because of external influence over it. It is rather a state formation, an engineered state.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative, challenging Ukrainian statehood and painting the West as the puppet-master of Ukrainian politics.
Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. Ukraine is not controlled by any foreign government, while its sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by most of the free world but were violated by Russia in 2014. The EU works closely with Ukraine and supports the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter’s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence.

97,ALL NATO COUNTRIES ARE SUBORDINATE TO THE US,"SUMMARY
The levels of sovereignty and independence of the member states of the Commonwealth of Independent Countries, Eurasian Economic Union, or the Collective Security Treaty Organisation are much larger than of the NATO or EU countries. What would happen to any NATO country which dares to oppose the US’s intention to station a military base on its territory?
The US does not have partners, all are subordinates. The West does not have a partnership culture. It sees other civilisations as those which have to be taught how to live. The British guidelines of communication with the aboriginal people read: if others do not get it, speak louder. This is the Western way of dealing with other countries.
DISPROOF
This disinformation message is aimed at undermining the image of the EU and NATO in light of allegedly more effective international organisations in the post-Soviet space in terms of inclusiveness in the decision making processes. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on the EU and NATO member states' subordination to the US.
Furthermore, the ""lack of a partnership culture"" argument is consistent with the pro-Kremlin narrative on the morally corrupt West aimed at portraying Russia as superior to the West in terms of values and morals. See earlier cases alleging that in contrast to Russia, western Europe is abandoning Christian roots and that unlike Russia, the West is not about fairness or solidarity and it degrades traditional values and endangers societies.
The EU Member States are sovereign countries and make sovereign decisions about their own security and policies. The US is an important ally to the EU but EU policy is not determined by the US, as explained by the EU High Representative. When it comes to NATO's decisions, they are made by consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries. Individual NATO member states have overseas bases on the basis of bilateral agreements and the principle of consent of the host-nation, in contrast with Russian bases on the territory of Moldova (Transnistria), Ukraine (the Autonomous Republic of Crimea) and Georgia (the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia).

98,POLAND’S ECONOMIC GROWTH IS ACHIEVED BY THE LOW LEVEL OF LIFE OF THE POLES,"SUMMARY
Since the 16th century, Poland has been the periphery of Europe – currently, it continues to be the European outsider. The economic growth of this country is achieved by the low level of life of the Poles. Also, the Poles have longer working week than any other country (after South Korea). The modern-day capitalists compensate for the lack of innovations in the Polish economy by the exploitation of workers and low salaries.
DISPROOF
This narrative is focused on the spread of misinformation on economic problems and failure of market reforms in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe - see other examples here and here.
During the last two decades, Poland has become one of the most dynamic economies in Europe. It enjoys uninterrupted economic growth since the early 1990s, with average GDP growth of 4.2% a year, doubling its GDP between 1990 and 2015. This growth allowed Poland to narrow the economic gap to the most developed EU countries – the Polish GDP (at PPP) has increased from 32% to 60% of the Western European average (EU-15).
According to the Bloomberg Innovative Index 2019, Poland became the 22nd most innovative economy in the world (among such countries as Canada, Italy, and New Zealand). As for the length of the working week, according to the OECD data on the average hours worked per year, Poland is the ninth country in the world (1.792 hours in 2019), with Mexico (2.148), Costa Rica (2.121) and South Korea (1.993) leading this list.",REAL
99,"VIOLENT EUROMAIDAN PROTESTERS KILLED 38 POLICEMEN, BURNED FIVE BUILDINGS","SUMMARY
During the Euromaidan protests, which culimnated in the overthrow of a democratically elected government, 38 police officers were killed and five buildings were burned.
DISPROOF
Recurring disinformation narrative on Ukraine and the Euromaidan protests.
There was no coup in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim here.
The claim attributing 38 law enforcement deaths and multiple instances of arson to protesters is made without evidence, and relies on exaggeration and omission. According to the UN Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, this oddly specific number is nearly three times overstated: 13 law enforcement officials, not 38, perished during the deadliest phase of the protests. Moreover, only one building, not five, burned down during Euromaidan. The immediate cause of the fire remains undetermined, although a Ukrainian parliamentary committee in May 2014 stated that the riot police assault which had shortly preceded the incident may have intensified the confrontation with the protesters and contributed to the fire.
Naturally, the claim wholly ignores both the casualties suffered by protesters and the wider context in which the protests turned violent, including draconian restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly imposed in January 2014. In all, 107 protesters were killed throughout Euromaidan, nine of whom had died before a single police officer was killed; four dozen were slaughtered by indiscriminate sniper fire in just one day.",REAL
100,NATO FORCED UKRAINE TO ADOPT ANTI-RUSSIAN FOREIGN POLICY,"SUMMARY
Ever since gaining independence in 1991, Ukraine has pursued a policy of keeping as much distance from Russia as possible, which is actually part of NATO’s expansion strategy.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narratives painting NATO as an aggressive, expansionist military bloc; casting Ukraine as an artificial and/or failing state, fatally dependent on Western sponsorship and unable to make its own strategic choices
NATO does not determine Ukrainian foreign policy, Ukraine does (Arts. 85, 92, 106, 116). As such, different Ukrainian presidents and governments have emphasised a variety of foreign-policy priorities and preferences.

101,THE U.S. USES ALL COLOUR REVOLUTION TECHNOLOGIES IN HONG KONG TO DESTABILIZE CHINA,"SUMMARY
All possible colour revolution technologies are used in Hong Kong. Americans organized all possible forces they have over the world. Many Ukrainian specialists in colour revolutions were arrested in Hong Kong. China is the main geopolitical challenge for the U.S. We talk about attempts to destabilize China through Hong Kong because it is not fully controlled by China, it has large numbers of transnational corporations and foreign citizens and a wider room for propaganda.
DISPROOF
This is conspiracy theory consistent with a recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narrative about US or West-funded Hong Kong protests.
Pro-Kremlin media have long used the narrative about anti-government protests being funded by the US. Examples include colour revolutions in post-Soviet states, the “Arab Spring” revolts, and Ukraine's Euromaidan in 2014. Western non-governmental organisations are often targeted by pro-Kremlin disinformation as agents of this subversive and state-driven influence.
The protests in Hong Kong started in June 2019 over a controversial extradition law, but have expanded to call for Hong Kong's leader to step down, an inquiry into alleged police brutality, for those who have been arrested to be released and greater democratic freedoms.

102,"BY STAGING EUROMAIDAN, THE WEST MEANT UKRAINE TO DIE","SUMMARY
Ukrainian Euromaidan was not spontaneous. It was prepared secretly from Ukrainian society from outside Ukraine. This allows considering Euromaidan an orange revolution. The aims of Euromaidan organizers were to change the geopolitical map of Europe, namely, to destroy the Eurasian Union, to tear Ukraine apart from Russia, and to weaken Russia. The latter headed the resistance to Western neo-liberal order.
In this political game, Ukraine became a bargaining chip without any independent value. The revolution organizers reckoned that without Russian ties Ukraine will be ultimately destroyed by inner contradictions. Only a few people in the West were interested in the fate of Ukraine. They wanted Ukraine to make its case and to die. Today’s Ukraine existence is fully dependent on the successful implementation of its only function, namely, to destabilize Russia. Euromaidan’s victory meant that Ukrainian statehood entered into the phase of agony. This agony will continue until Ukraine will preserve any chance to conduct aggressive, anti-Russian politics.
DISPROOF
This publication shares a conspiracy which contains recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about coup d'etat in Ukraine, West-staged colour revolutions, and West's attempts to tear Ukraine apart of Russia and to make it anti-Russian.
There was no coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was a reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s violent dispersal of peaceful student protests against Yanukovych's sudden decision to withdraw from the Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk here.
The Western countries did not mean Ukraine to die as alleged and, on the contrary, continue to support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and to provide it financial assistance. The EU is the biggest foreign donor of Ukraine. Ukraine is the largest recipient of the EU’s macro-financial aid among all non-EU countries. Since 2014, Ukraine has received on average 650 million euros every year from the EU, twice as much as from the United States. Individual EU member-states, primarily Germany, France, and the UK, have also provided financial support to Ukraine. For instance, between 2014 and 2017 Germany contributed a total of €786 million, much of it towards education and post-emergency reconstruction. The United Kingdom provided €105 million, supporting reforms in areas such as peace-building, conflict prevention, and public sector management.",REAL

In this case, the Polish elite allegedly uses the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine in order to frighten the Poles with Russia. See other examples of this message here, here and here.
The statement that the main political forces of Poland try to prevent the reconciliation between Ukraine and Russia using their conflict for domestic goals is a conspiracy theory.

104,NATO PROVOKES RUSSIA IN THE BLACK SEA REGION,"SUMMARY
NATO provokes Russia in the Black Sea region.
However, if we analyse the events of recent months, we can see that tensions in the Black Sea region are provoked not by Russia, but by NATO. (…) The Russian Federation Council (Upper House of Parliament) then said that NATO was flexing its’ muscles and trying to demonstrate its presence in the western and southern border regions of Russia, while Georgia had become “part of the NATO mechanism for influencing Moscow”.
The US has long had the idea of establishing a ‘sanitary blockade’ by states hostile to Russia – from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. (…) They will increase the pressure on Russia, and not just by their own efforts. Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Georgia should also participate. […] The Black Sea region was nothing more than a new source of tension for the Americans, where they could provoke Russia. The recent incidents in the Kerch Strait are clear proof of this.
DISPROOF
No evidence given. Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on NATO belligerence towards Russia and on Russophobia.
NATO seeks no confrontation with Russia. NATO is a defensive alliance. Its purpose is to protect the member states. NATO's exercises and military deployments in the Black Sea are not directed against Russia – or any other country. NATO has reached out to Russia consistently, transparently and publicly over the past 29 years.
Concerning Georgia, NATO agreed at the Wales Summit to offer Georgia a substantial package of assistance to strengthen Georgia's defence and interoperability capabilities with the Alliance. In August 2015, a NATO-Georgian Joint Training and Evaluation Centre was inaugurated in Krtsanisi to contribute to the training and interoperability of Georgian and Alliance personnel. The Training Centre is not directed against Russia, but contributes to stability by making Georgia's armed forces more professional, and by reinforcing the democratic controls over them.
Moreover, NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Every sovereign nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security, one that Russia has also subscribed to, and should respect. NATO enlargement has brought more stability and prosperity to Europe, including Russia.

105,NATO BURIED LATVIA’S AND LITHUANIA’S INDEPENDENCE AND IS CURRENTLY TARGETING BELARUS,"SUMMARY
NATO has since buried the independence of Latvia and Lithuania, now its military forces aim to steal Belarus’ independence. To prevent this, it is important to remain Russia’s ally, to discuss the establishment of a Russian airbase in Belarus, to send a diplomatic note of protest to the U.S. and to send opposition politicians who support the location of US military bases in the vicinity of Belarus to court martial as national traitors. The whole Belarusian opposition celebrated the stationing of U.S. troops in Lithuania. When American tanks target the windows of their houses they feel safe.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory aimed to discredit the West and democratic Belarusian opposition. It is consistent with recurring propagandist narratives about the Baltic states' lost sovereignty and their subordination to the US and NATO, US/NATO aggressive plans towards Belarus, and destructive actions of the Belarusian opposition guided by the West. It was not reported that any of Belarus' opposition political parties praised the stationing of regular US troops in Lithuania.

106,"THE RAIL BALTIC PROJECT IS FROZEN, IT WILL BE DESTROYED IN A WAR","SUMMARY
The construction of the Rail Baltic railway was postponed for another two years because the Baltics don’t have enough money. It seems like the Rail Baltic project has permanently “frozen”.
There is no point in building infrastructure to the “front line” because it would be destroyed in the first hours of a large scale war.
DISPROOF
Rail Baltic is currently undergoing a design phase. In March 2019, a contract was signed to design a section of the Rail Baltic railway in Estonia. This was the first design contract signed for the main line of Rail Baltica. In April 2019, a similar contract was signed for a section in Lithuania, and in July, a design works contract was signed in Latvia. By September 2019, design works and site investigations had started on 411 km of the railroad.
Pro-Kremlin media often use the narrative of a ""great war that will destroy everything, so there is no point in doing anything"". This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative based on groundless speculation. Sometimes it's used in combination with the narrative that ""Russia is not a threat"" (and dismissing the annexation of Crimea). Other times, the narrative that ""Russia is not a threat"" is paired with the narrative where Russia destroys its adversaries with a nuclear bomb.",REAL

We should close the Cold War era and establish a new global security system, which covers the entire world. NATO is a monstrous relic – it will keep provoking conflicts as long as it exists. This organisation cannot function another way – it always needs an enemy. That is why NATO should have been dissolved at the moment of the liquidation of the Warsaw Pact.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, portraying NATO as a threat to global peace because it has an aggressive agenda. NATO is a defensive alliance, whose purpose is to protect its member states. Its exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia – or any other country. The claim that NATO is encircling or threatening Russia is one of the myths about this organization.
NATO is regularly updating the military requirements for civilian infrastructure, at a time when there are increased challenges to security. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the Readiness Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defense and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment.

108,EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CONDEMNS UKRAINE’S ACTIONS DURING WWII,"SUMMARY
Ukraine, as the heiress of the USSR, was under the barrel of criticism from the European Union. The new resolution from the European Parliament condemns the actions of the Soviet Army, which included four Ukrainian fronts. Millions of Ukrainians are recognised as invaders.
DISPROOF
This is a repeated narrative of the USSR's innocence during World War II. The resolution entitled “Importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe” was adopted by the European Parliament on 19 September 2019. The resolution is not directed at Ukraine, but to the crimes of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The resolution emphasises that the two totalitarian regimes cooperated in the political, economic and military fields, and through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the secret protocol thereto, agreed to divide Europe.
The resolution says that members of the European Parliament are concerned about the efforts of the current Russian leadership to whitewash the crimes committed by the Soviet totalitarian regime, and see them as a dangerous component of the information war against democratic Europe. The text also emphasises that ""Russia remains the greatest victim of communist totalitarianism and that its development into a democratic state will be impeded as long as the government, the political elite and political propaganda continue to whitewash communist crimes and glorify the Soviet totalitarian regime.""
Throughout the post-Soviet space, the policy of the USSR is recognised as criminal. For example, in Ukraine, the Law on Decommunisation, enacted by the Cabinet of Ministers, entered into force in 2015. The document recognises the communist totalitarian regime of 1917-1991 in Ukraine as criminal and pursuing a policy of state terror.",REAL
109,NATO/US MILITARY EXERCISES IN EUROPE ARE DIRECTED AGAINST RUSSIA AND BELARUS,"SUMMARY
Future military exercises of NATO and Americans in Europe are directed against Russia and Belarus. Russia’s reaction will be extremely negative. Such large-scale exercises with Navy, Air Force and the involvement of heavy armoured vehicles, can be considered as very serious military preparations. Moreover, as preparations for war.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, portraying NATO as a threat to peace and about the belligerent West aiming to conduct aggressive activities against Russia. When it comes to the conspiracy theory about NATO's plans to wage a war against Russia, NATO has addressed this on its official website. Any claims that NATO is preparing an attack on Russia are absurd.

110,JIT IGNORES RUSSIAN ARGUMENTS AND DATA ON MH17 DOWNING,"SUMMARY
JIT ignores Russian arguments and data on MH17 downing.
The JIT accuses Russia of being jointly responsible for the tragedy. The Russian government, which has so far been excluded from the investigation, complains that investigators have ignored Russian arguments and data. For example, the investigation team did not pay any attention to documents proving that the missile hit by Boeing belonged to the Ukrainian army. The experiments of the Russian Almaz-Antey group, which manufactures anti-aircraft equipment, including the Buk systems, were also ignored, confirming that the Buk was fired from the area controlled by the Ukrainian army.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on flight MH17 denying Russia's responsibility.
Russia's interest in aiding the JIT investigation is not a relevant condition of its membership in JIT. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke told a Russian newspaper that ""if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.""
The ""evidence"" claimed by Russia, namely radar data and the ""field experiment"" conducted by the Russian military company Almaz-Antey, is only a small sample of misleading claims advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have contradicted one another. Also, Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta found the claim that the Buk was of ""Ukrainian origin"" to be fabricated.
The Dutch-led criminal investigation by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has been ongoing since 2014. On 28 September 2016, the JIT announced that flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from the 9M38 series, which was launched by a BUK TELAR missile system. The system was transported from the Russian Federation to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in Eastern Ukraine, from where the missile was launched. After firing, the system - with 1 missing missile - went back to the Russian Federation. On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation.",REAL
111,"REAL UKRAINIAN PATRIOTS FOUGHT FOR DPR/LPR, REAL BELARUSIAN PATRIOTS CONSIDER BELARUS AND RUSSIA AS ONE","SUMMARY
The enemy imposes a breakaway of post-Soviet countries from Russia presenting this as patriotism and protection of national interests. Real Ukrainian patriots are located in Donbas and fought in the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. Those who shout “Glory to Ukraine” are not not patriots but destroyers. They seemingly want to turn Ukraine into a concentration camp, to bring hatred among people and wage war. They are the forces who are used by external actors to destroy Ukraine and to turn it into the territory of a military clash of civilisations.
This is also true for Belarus. The real Belarusian patriot is the one who understands that Belarus and Russia are one body, and that together with Russia, Belarus has a future. The one who opposes the Union with Russia is not a patriot. He is either a foolish man or the enemy of the Belarusian state and people.
DISPROOF
This message is consistent with recurring propagandistic narratives about war in Ukraine and Western attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations. It presents a close union with Russia as the only positive way of development for Belarus and gives a completely distorted view on the war in Ukraine, presenting Russia-backed armed formations which violated Ukraine's territorial integrity as Ukrainian patriots. The war in eastern Ukraine is an act of aggression by the Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the Belarusian opposition is tasked by the West to disrupt Belarusian-Russian integration, that the West targets the Union State between Belarus and Russia, and putting forward a ridiculous false dilemma, claiming that the only possible scenario for Ukraine and Belarus to prevent their descent into Nazism through the politicisation of national clothes is to become a Russian western federal area.",REAL

Among them - the eradication of monopolies among digital companies, training of staff at all levels of government, analysts of different spheres of cooperation, election commissions, communication experts, journalists, legislators and civil society. But most importantly in this list - is the reform of the journalistic community and increase the level of trust in the media and politicians. To achieve this, the researchers are advised not to restrict freedom of speech and censorship to introduce and improve democratic mechanisms for the establishment of full transparency in the work of the media.

117,ELITE AND MEDIA DRIVEN ANTI-RUSSIA CAMPAIGN IN POLAND ENCOURAGES THE PURCHASE OF WESTERN WEAPONS,"SUMMARY
The Polish political elite and West-owned media concerns carry out a large-scale campaign promoting the anti-Russian attitudes in Poland. Key goal of this campaign is to persuade the Poles that they need expensive Western weapons and natural resources (which are cheaper in Russia). The Polish public opinion is made to support these expensive projects through a threat, real or alleged.
DISPROOF
This message is a pro-Kremlin narrative on the “elites vs. people” – in this case, the political “elites” of Central and Eastern European countries are fully controlled by the West/USA, manipulating their societies in order to make them anti-Russian. See other examples of this message here, here and here.
The statement that the political elites of Poland and the Western controlled media groups carry out a coordinated policy of spread of the anti-Russian attitudes in Poland is a conspiracy theory.
The position of the main Polish political parties on purchasing Western weapons and the deployment of NATO troops in Poland reflects the Polish public opinion on these issues. For example, 65% of the Poles support the deployment of troops from other NATO countries in Poland, and 81% - fully support the Polish membership in NATO (CBOS NATO poll, March 2019). This poll had shown a substantial increase in public support for the Polish membership in NATO (+19%) immediately after the Russian annexation of Crimea. This fact indicates that the Polish perception of NATO and Russia comes not from alleged “elite” manipulations, but from assessment of aggressive Russian actions in Ukraine by the Polish citizens.",REAL
118,THE WAR AGAINST DONBAS PEOPLE IS WAGED BY SUCCESSORS OF THE HITLERITES,"SUMMARY
The claim that Ukraine is in a state of war with Russia is absurd. This is a civil war which was provoked by a coup d’état. Ukrainian state officials promised to kill everyone in Donbas and to drop a nuclear bomb on them. This is a conflict between one part of the Ukrainian people who consider themselves part of Russian civilization and the aggressive one, supported by the West. This other side wants to tear Ukraine away from Russian World and to turn it into the buffer area between the EU and NATO, on the one hand, and Russia, on the other. This side of the conflict includes the darkest forces, successors and accomplices of the Hitlerites. The Donbas people are the successors of the winners over Nazism, while the war is being waged by those on the other side who consider themselves successors of fascist accomplices. How can Donbas people be reunited with the rest of Ukraine where flagrant Nazi gangs organize their marches and praise the murderers?
DISPROOF
This publication is a mix of groundless generalization, conspiracy theories and manipulations, which follow recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about 2014 Ukraine's coup d'état, and Fascist / Nazi Ukraine. It is aimed to legitimize Russia-backed armed forces in Donbas and to demonize Ukrainian authorities by painting them as successors of the Hitlerites.
It also seriously misrepresents the ongoing acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine referring to alleged Ukrainian authorities' plans to exterminate the Donbas people including by dropping a nuclear bomb on them. Ukraine has no nuclear bombs. After signing the Budapest Memorandum Ukraine removed all nuclear weapons from its soil in exchange for assurances that Russia would respect its sovereignty.

Last but not least, there was no coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014.

119,BRITISH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE WILL MANAGE THE INTEGRATION OF MOLDOVA INTO NATO,"SUMMARY
Moldova will become even closer to NATO – British military intelligence will take care of the integration. Next week, a group of British troops from the British Military Advisory Training Team (BMATT) will arrive in Chisinau. […] The British Military Advisory Training Team is not included in the list of well-known military (intelligence) institutions in the United Kingdom. Specifically, Moldova will be visited by British specialists from the Czech branch of this training group, which is based in the city of Wyszkow and specializes in countries of Eastern Europe. It is assumed that BMATT experts coordinate their activities with British military intelligence (Defense intelligence).
DISPROOF
Recurring anti-NATO narrative presenting any military exercise of the Moldovan military as preparation for NATO membership.
A team of the British Military Advisory Training Team (BMATT), based in Vyškov, Czechia, will deliver a junior command and leadership course to 30 personnel from the Armed Forces of Moldova. This kind of training have been delivered also last year, at Bulboaca poligon of the Moldovan National Army.
The British Military Advisory Training Team is a joint British and Czech team, located in Vyškov, within the Military Academy of the Czech Armed Forces, and was set up in 2000. The team’s mission is to provide military training courses to partner countries, in order to further develop their professional armed forces and their capabilities to participate in regional stability and multinational peace support operations.
Moldova is a constitutionally neutral state, who has never declared its intention to join NATO. Moldova set up relations with NATO in 1992, when Moldova joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, aiming to draw closer to Euro-Atlantic standards and institutions.

123,THE MH17 JIT IGNORED INFORMATION PROVIDED BY ALMAZ-ANTEY,"SUMMARY
The MH17 Joint Investigation Team ignored information provided by Buk manufacturer Almaz-Antey, which asses that the missile that struck Boeing belonged to the Ukrainian armed forces and that the airplane was shot down by a missile from the territory controlled by the Ukrainian army.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the downing of flight MH17
Both claims by Buk manufacturer Almaz-Antey were debunked back in 2015 by Bellingcat.
The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy.  At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters.
The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation  and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation.
On 24 May 2018, JIT stated that the BUK-TELAR that was used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. The JIT reached this conclusion after extensive comparative research.

The West is trying to influence Russia through “neoliberal values” and is manipulating Russian gays, convincing them that they must accept all Western values if they want to get rights.
DISPROOF
There is no evidence given for this claim. It is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the West's moral decay. ""Threatened values"" is one of the most common narratives used by pro-Kremlin outlets.
According to the deputy director of the Levada Center Denis Volkov, ""in 2013, there was a jump in negative emotions towards LGBT people [in Russia]. It can be explained with great certainty by the campaign that was unleashed in the leading Russian media around the so-called ""laws against homosexuality propaganda"". By now, it seems that the negative effect of this campaign, public opinion gradually ran out of steam"". The original Levada study, conducted in 2019, can be found here.

125,"BLOCKING CRIMEA, THE NEW NATO/US STRATEGY IN THE BLACK SEA","SUMMARY
Despite reports accusing Russia of deploying forces to take over Black and Azov seas, it is not difficult to understand that it is NATO who is trying to increase tension there due to military exercises such as Sea Breeze and Agile Spirit. The US may organize different provocative actions in the Black Sea using countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Ukraine, to get Moscow used to have US ships entering in its maritime space.
DISPROOF
No evidence is provided to support this claim. This is part of a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative portraying NATO as an aggressive power and Russia as acting in a self-defensive way.
Sea Breeze military exercises have been taking place each year since 1997, while Agile Spirit joint military exercises started in 2001 under a different name and were celebrated on a biennial base since then, so they can’t be considered a source of increased tensions. In both cases, the purpose is to enhance inter-operability between NATO and allied armies.

126,"GRETA IS WRONG, REAL SCIENCE HAS NO PROOFS OF HUMAN IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE","SUMMARY
Russian meteorologists forecast abnormally warm weather in the northern part of European and Asian parts of Russia from October to March, whereas an abnormal cold will come to the Russian south. Does it mean that 16-year old Greta Thunberg is right about anything? Of course not. The only thing we can reliably speak of is sufficiently radical climate change, but there is nothing unusual about it. Real science knowns absolutely no proofs of human impacts on climate change. If only the Nobel Prize for the former US Vice President Al Gore is not considered as a proof, but this is rather a non-scientific mishap.
DISPROOF
This is not true that science does not possess evidence of human impacts on climate change. On the contrary, there is a strong consensus among publishing climate scientists (around 97%) that humans are responsible for climate change. The greater the climate expertise among surveyed scientists, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming. This publication is a conspiracy which is consistent with the recurring propagandistic narrative that global warming is a ""hoax"" perpetrated by special interest groups like green businesses that stand to benefit from the climate hysteria.
One of the misunderstandings about the global warming presented in the publication is that it mixes up climate, which refers to how the atmosphere acts over a long period of time, with the weather, which describes what’s happening on a much shorter time scale. Look for debunks of 'unreliable climate change models' and other climate change myths here. Preventing dangerous consequences of climate change is the key priority for the EU. 
In reality, global warming has a global effect and it is even faster in Russia. As Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment 2018 report says on page 20: “The pace of temperature increase in Russia is faster than the average on Earth in the period 1976-2017; the average annual temperature in the world rose by 0.18°C in a decade, while in Russia the same index was 0.45°C.” Northern countries feel the consequences of global warming quicker than those in equatorial or tropical regions because their permafrost layers are melting.
The Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 was awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and former US Vice President Al Gore for their efforts to obtain and disseminate information about the climate challenge. ""In Gore's case, certainly, the award was grounded in his tireless campaign to put the climate crisis on the political agenda,"" the Nobel Foundation Website says.

132,EU INTEGRATION MEANS PROPERTY RESTITUTION FROM A LARGE PART OF UKRAINIAN TERRITORY IN FAVOUR OF EU COUNTRIES,"SUMMARY
Poland and possibly Hungary are preparing documents on property located in Western Ukraine. Restitution is the key rule of EU integration. This is what Latvia went through and it had to return almost a half of Riga’s historical centre to previous owners. Restitution of property on the territories of Bessarabia, Zakarpattia, Bukovina, Galicia, Volyn, and part of Podillia regions are open questions. One may wonder if the rights of the Russian empire over Kyiv can be treated as restitution too.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about massive restitution claims that Ukrainians will face in case Ukraine joins the EU. In reality, property restitution is not a condition for EU membership and is not on the agenda of EU-Ukrainian relations.
""Restitution is one of the most mythologised issues in Ukrainian politics. Politicians and experts contribute hugely to the belief that European integration will inevitably lead to a review of property rights and many ordinary citizens will lose their homes or have to pay compensation to foreigners, primarily to Poles,"" Europe Insight analysis reads. It includes an expert opinion that the property restitution issue is ""above the EU's competence"" and could not be inserted into the EU-Ukraine Association agreement even theoretically.

Therefore Ukraine will return in the situation similar to periods in Polish history when the nobles had rather wide competences and the king did not have real power.
DISPROOF
This is a recurrent narrative aimed to discredit Ukrainian statehood and to draw imminently negative consequences of Ukraine's integration with the EU.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Zelenskyy has neither army nor police, he is surrounded by corrupted predators, post-Soviet countries are feudal principalities governed by the West, and that the idea of Ukraine is based on a mythologised lie.

134,EUROPEAN COMMISSION DID NOT DETECT SIGNS OF A DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN FOR EU ELECTIONS,"SUMMARY
Despite frequent EU announcements “about the threat of Russian propaganda”, in its report of June this year, the European Commission acknowledged that it did not detect signs of a public disinformation campaign from abroad for the European Parliamentary elections, although it reported attempts by “some Russian sources” to influence voters.
DISPROOF
This claim is a distortion of the actual report, taking the following sentence out of context: ""Available evidence has not allowed us to identify a distinct cross-border disinformation campaign from external sources specifically targeting the European elections”. The next sentence provides further clarification: ""However, the evidence collected revealed a continued and sustained disinformation activity by Russian sources aiming to suppress turnout and influence voter preferences”.
Asked if the report doesn’t contradict itself, Security Commissioner Julian King said that disinformation aimed at dividing Europeans was ""increasingly locally focused"", which the report explains as follows: ""Instead of conducting large-scale operations on digital platforms, these actors, in particular linked to Russian sources, now appeared to be opting for smaller-scale, localised operations that are harder to detect and expose.""

136,INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE’S REPORT FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN INTERVENTION IN THE US ELECTIONS,"SUMMARY
The US Senate Intelligence Committee’s final report on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections offers no evidence, but many reheated allegations and allusions by so-called experts who have themselves now been exposed as the actual election influencers.
Not surprisingly, the “results” of the report are cited as conclusive evidence that the Democrats were right and President Donald Trump wrong about 2016, Russia, Ukraine and the US presidential elections.
The problem is that the committee provides no concrete evidence for its statements – just allegations.
Since Hillary Clinton blamed “Russian hackers” in July 2016 for the revelations about corruption within the DNC, the Washington establishment has been eager to blame Moscow for all the evils of the US political system, real or imagined. The Senate Intelligence Committee’s report seems to be nothing more than an attempt to warm up the long-cooled corpse of a conspiracy that the Mueller report should have buried and left to rest in peace.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Robert Mueller's investigation did conclude that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Mueller's report determined that there were ""two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election"". It led to US senators' proposals to extend sanctions on Russia to deter it from further election meddling.
The claim that the report provides no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion is spurious. Gathering evidence of ""collusion"" - which is not a legal concept - fell outside the scope of the investigation. The aim of the probe was not merely to ascertain contacts between the Trump Campaign and Russia-linked individuals during the election period, but to establish whether these interactions were deliberate enough on the part of Trump Campaign officials to sustain charges of conspiracy (p. 2).
The report explicitly identifies ""numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"" (p. 9).",REAL
137,THE BALTIC STATES JOINED THE USSR IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW,"SUMMARY
Riga was liberated from Germans in 1944. The liberation of the Baltic states was itself a big operation and several fronts participated in the process. The Baltic states consider that their countries were occupied during 1944-1991. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union happened in accordance with the international law.
DISPROOF
A recurring attempt of historical revisionism aiming at justifying Soviet actions.
On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a non-aggression (Molotov-Ribbentrop) pact whose secret protocols divided the territories belonging to Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, and Romania into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The Baltic States were not beneficiaries of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Like other countries mentioned in the pact, they lost their independence and territories. Soviet occupation of the Baltic States lasted for 50 years and resulted in mass deportations and repressions against local populations.
24 December 1989, the Parliament of the USSR, the Congress of the People’s Deputies, adopted a resolution, denouncing the secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. An English translation of the full text here:
The Congress notes that during this period the relations of the USSR with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were regulated by a system of treaties. Pursuant to the 1920 Peace Treaties and 1926-1933 Non-Aggression Treaties, the signatories were obliged to honour each other’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability under any circumstances. The Soviet Union had assumed similar obligations to Poland and Finland.

138,THE FRENCH PRESIDENT IS AWARE OF THE DEFINITIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE CRIMEA ISSUE,"SUMMARY
The French President is well aware that the question of Crimea is definitely settled and today it is time to start again the discussions with Russia. For the Russians, Crimea is their Alsace-Lorraine.
DISPROOF
No evidence given that Macron embraces the Russian point of view on the subject.
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the annexation of Crimea by Russia and its progressive recognition in the world. No international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014 amid the presence of Russian troops. The UNGA adopted the resolution 68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine. For the EU statement on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, see here.
The official transcript of the speech given by Macron in August 2019 at the conference with ambassadors does not mention Crimea apart of the  Russian-Ukrainian conflict: ""obviously one of the decisive issues to move forward in this direction is our ability to move forward on the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, thus, on the implementation of the Minsk agreements”. Macron also highlighted that ""we must be intractable when our sovereignty or that of our partners is threatened"".
The borders of Ukraine, including Crimea, were recognised and guaranteed after its independence in 1991 by international agreements, some of which were signed by Russia itself.
Unlike Alsace and Lorraine, regions disputed during the I and II World Wars, the totality of Crimea’s indigenous population was deported under Stalin’s era to Central Asia. The indigenous population started to go back to Crimea quietly during the last years of the USSR and then openly after the collapse of USSR in 1991. Currently, the question of the rights of the indigenous population under Russian occupation is also preoccupying UNESCO. It concerns ""disrespect of human rights and fundamental freedoms manifested by Russia since the outset of the occupation of the peninsula"".

139,RUSSIA WILL CREATE MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILES BECAUSE OF THE USA,"SUMMARY
Russia will work on the creation of medium-range missiles because the United States was the first to start creating such weapons in violation of the INF Treaty.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the INF Treaty.
Russia bears primary responsibility for the end of the INF Treaty, because it has produced, tested and deployed the 9M729 missile, which violates the agreement. In July 2014, the then-US President Obama officially accused Russia of testing a missile in violation of the INF Treaty, which prohibits the US or Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of between 500 and 5500 kilometres.
In a joint statement released after the meeting held at NATO Headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday 4 and Wednesday 5 December 2018, NATO Foreign Ministers stated that the United States has remained in full compliance with its obligations under the INF Treaty since it entered into force and that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security.""
US and NATO have repeatedly engaged with Russia to preserve the INF treaty. For background on pro-Kremlin myths on the INF Treaty see here.
The recent ""Statement by the North Atlantic Council on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty"" noted that ""Russia today remains in violation of the INF Treaty, despite years of U.S. and Allied engagement, including a final opportunity over six months to honour its Treaty obligations.

DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the INF Treaty.
Russia bears primary responsibility for the end of the INF Treaty, because it has produced, tested and deployed the 9M729 missile, which violates the agreement. In July 2014, the then-US President Obama officially accused Russia of testing a missile in violation of the INF Treaty, which prohibits the US or Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of between 500 and 5500 kilometres.
In a joint statement released after the meeting held at NATO Headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday 4 and Wednesday 5 December 2018, NATO Foreign Ministers stated that the United States has remained in full compliance with its obligations under the INF Treaty since it entered into force and that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security.""
US and NATO have repeatedly engaged with Russia to preserve the INF treaty. For background on pro-Kremlin myths on the INF Treaty see here.
The recent ""Statement by the North Atlantic Council on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty"" noted that ""Russia today remains in violation of the INF Treaty, despite years of U.S. and Allied engagement, including a final opportunity over six months to honour its Treaty obligations. Russia bears sole responsibility for the demise of the Treaty"".",REAL
141,KYIV DOES NOT WANT REBEL HELD TERRITORIES TO REJOIN UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
Ukraine does not  want a return of the LDNR because of fears that voters in the Donbas will throw out the Nazis in power.
DISPROOF
This is another story that Nazis and nationalists are in power in Ukraine and are encouraging the war in Donbas.
According to the results of the 21 July 2019 vote, only one political party claiming to be 'nationalistic' passed the threshold for representation in the Verkhovna Rada. The Parliament of the ninth convocation got 424 candidates.
Ukraine is also interested in the return of the occupied territories, but to Ukrainian jurisdiction. The United States and the EU have repeatedly stated that the implementation of the Minsk agreements is impeded precisely by Russia and the militants of the so-called LDNR. They are the ones who violate the ceasefire, hold unrecognised elections in the occupied territories and distribute Russian passports to residents of occupied Donbas.
Also, the Ukrainian leadership signed the so-called Steinmeier formula. The document provides that the occupied territories of Donbas will receive special status on the day of local elections. First, temporarily, and then on an ongoing basis - if the democratic process is confirmed by the OSCE. The key is that the elections will be held in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine and the law of Ukraine.

There is no evidence that the LGBT+ community in Lithuania interfered in the Polish parliamentary elections.
The Lithuanian and Polish LGBT+ organizations have criticised the Lithuanian prime minister's idea to nominate Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of Poland's conservative Law and Justice party, for a top state award. These critics cannot be considered as interference in the electoral process in Poland.

143,ALFRED KINSEY’S 1948 REPORT ON SEXUALITY WAS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE MOST DEVIANT SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR,"SUMMARY
Alfred Kinsey’s 1948 report on sexuality was designed to promote the most deviant sexual behaviour. The report gave birth to the sexual revolution, which upset and overturned all values. Kinsey himself was a homosexual maniac who raped dozens of children. The sexual revolution that was born of this theory will upset and overthrow all Western values. In January 2018, UNESCO published its recommendations on sexual education in which it places great emphasis on the right to enjoy the pleasures of flesh.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative portraying the West as a decadent, and immoral society that destroys traditional values and promotes deviant sexual behaviour.
The Kinsey Reports, two scholarly books on human sexual behaviour, written by Alfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy, Clyde Martin and Paul Gebhard published respectively in 1948 and 1951 were controversial among the general public simply because they challenged conventional beliefs about sexuality and because they discussed subjects that had previously been taboo.

147,THE BALTIC STATES ARE DYING OUT AND SOON WILL BE INHABITED BY PEOPLE FROM CONGO AND ZIMBABWE,"SUMMARY
Baltic experts have come to the conclusion that the only way out of the demographic catastrophe of the Baltic States will be the immigration from tropical Africa. This means a demographic surrender: Baltic States recognize that Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians cannot be saved from extinction and that the only way to stop depopulation of the Baltic States is foreign migrants.
So far the Baltic states cover their demographic shame with impoverished Ukrainians who are fleeing the “European choice” of Ukraine. However, the real fun for the  Baltic states’ authorities will start when people born in Congo, Zimbabwe, and Equatorial Guinea will become new Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. After it happens, one will be able to laugh as the Baltic states finally get what they deserve.
DISPROOF
This publication is a typical hahaganda narative aimed to ridicule the Baltic states by exacerbating the demographic decline that they face. In fact, many other eastern European countries experience a population decline, including Russia.
See our earlier story about Estonia-related hahaganda and earlier disinformation cases alleging that the Baltic states are dying because they chose not to be with Russia and that Lithuania will be depopulated in 20 years, and that decaying Latvia and Lithuania envy Belarus its strategic relations with Russia.",REAL

The [Orthodox Church of Ukraine] was created as a political tool needed for its backers to expand their influence and financial wealth. Agressive actions of the OCU undrmine the concept of the Orthodox Church as a traditional religious system [sic]. These agressive actions will apparently lead to a further split among the Orthodox Church [sic]. 
DISPROOF
No evidence given. Conspiracy theory and recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Western attempts to instigate revolutions in EU neighbourhood. Pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets have frequently attacked the establishment of an autocephalous Ukrainian church.

Latvia is engaged in rewriting history, speaking out against the fireworks in honour of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Riga from Nazi invaders. Soviet troops liberated Riga from the Nazis on 13 October 1944, the victory of the USSR in the Great Patriotic War does not need to be rewritten, this is an historical fact.
DISPROOF
Another example of pro-Kremlin historical revisionism.  More cases here.
The Soviet Union occupied Latvia twice. The first time the occupation lasted a year. In the summer of 1940, when Nazi Germany attacked France, the Red Army occupied Riga. This was enabled through a secret protocol to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on the separation of spheres of influence between the Soviet Union and fascist Germany. The second time, Soviet troops captured Latvia on 13 October 1944. Modern Latvia received full independence only after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In 2015, the Ministers of Justice of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia signed a joint declaration on the calculation and the need to receive compensation for damage caused by the occupation of the USSR. The Baltic States' leadership have repeatedly emphasised that Russia is the successor of the USSR, therefore, it has an obligation to compensate the Baltic countries for the losses incurred.

152,THE US HAS DESTABILISED ERITREA TO PROVOKE MASSIVE MIGRATION FLOWS TO EUROPE,"SUMMARY
For the past 15 years the US government has deliberately destabilised Eritrea by supporting terrorism, proxy wars, regime-change and sanctions in order to provoke massive migration flows of young Eritreans to Europe. The US aims to empty Eritrea of young people in order to invade it more easily and to punish Eritrea for not agreeing to host a US military base in the Dahlak Islands.
The following organisations are complicit in the US’s forced migration strategy in Eritrea: UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch. These organisations attract ever-greater funding thanks to the increase in migrations flows of Africans towards Europe.
DISPROOF

153,UKRAINE FAILED TO WITHDRAW ITS ARMED FORCES ACCORDING TO STEINMEIER FORMULA,"SUMMARY
The so-called Steinmeier formula has its first failure. It’s about last week’s agreement that Ukraine and the self-proclaimed republics will withdraw their armed forces. They promised to begin from two settlements in Donbas – Petrovskyy and Zolotoye. What happened instead? Petrovskyy was shelled by the Ukrainian security officers. In Zolotoye they carry out a certain operation of the combined forces.
DISPROOF
One of the pro-Kremlin messages about the Kyiv government sabotaging peace in the Donbas region. See previous cases about the Minsk agreements and the war in Ukraine.
According to the daily report by the SMM OSCE, the Mission recorded fewer ceasefire violations in both Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but those violations were fixed from both sides. The same situation is with the withdrawal of forces. The SMM OSCE saw 16 weapons in violation of withdrawal lines on both sides of the contact line.
Specifically, Steinmeier's formula calls for elections to be held in the separatist-held territories under Ukrainian legislation and the supervision of the OSCE. The withdrawal of forces is the other step that should be done before the planned elections. ""There won't be any elections there if the troops are still there,"" said the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",REAL
154,MISSILE DEFENCE SYSTEM WAS DEPLOYED IN ROMANIA WITHOUT PERMISSION,"SUMMARY
NATO became the tool of foreign policy for the US. Once the state becomes a NATO member, nobody is asking it for permission to deploy certain types of armament. This is how the missile defence system was deployed in Romania and the same is going to happen in Poland.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narratives on NATO and US global role. This is an example of a narrative shift about the deployment of missile defence systems in Romania and Poland. Before, it was claimed that the US is deploying systems that are capable of launching Tomahawk-type cruise missiles, prohibited by the INF agreement.
In fact, both Romania and Poland agreed to host missile defence systems. In 2010, Romania agreed to host Standard Missile 3 interceptor. As for Poland, Poland and the US signed agreement on the deployment of ground-based ballistic missile defence interceptors on the territory of Poland in 2008, but the project was cancelled following a fierce response from the Polish government. Instead, Aegis Ashore Ballistic Missile Defence System (AABMDS) will be deployed in an anti-missile station in Redzikowo, expected to be completed in 2020.",REAL
155,UKRAINE WILL LEGALISE MARIJUANA TO MANIPULATE THE CITIZENS,"SUMMARY
In Ukraine, a law on the legalisation of marijuana is ready. Slowly, but surely, the country is moving towards the drug dope.

DISPROOF
There is currently no item on the agenda of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on the review of the legalisation of medical cannabis in the country. This fact was confirmed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who said that now is not the time to legalise marijuana in Ukraine.
In the spring, a petition appeared in Ukraine demanding the legalisation of marijuana for medical use, the document collected the necessary number of signatures from citizens. The Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Human Rights, National Minorities and Inter-ethnic Relations supported the petition.

The European Union imposed large-scale sanctions on Russia due to US pressure.
DISPROOF
Another conspiracy theory that the US controls the policies of the European Union. All EU countries are independent states whose policies are not regulated externally by any other country.
The first wave of EU sanctions against Russia was introduced immediately after the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea - in March 2014. The European Union introduced the first sanctions against Russia for starting a war in Donbas in July 2014. The EU introduces various types of restrictive measures: diplomatic measures, individual restrictive measures, economic sanctions and more. All sanctions packages are renewed every six months for five years, each time the list of sanctions is gradually expanding. On 14th October 2019, the Council extended the restrictive measures by the EU addressing the use and proliferation of chemical weapons until 16 October 2020 which apply to four people involved in the Salisbury attack.

158,NATO IS AN INSTRUMENT OF US FOREIGN POLICY AND POSES A THREAT TO RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
NATO is simply an instrument of US foreign policy. No one has any doubts about it. This is what is being talked about in Europe.
The stationing of NATO weapons very close to the Russian borders is a “destructive activity” and poses a threat to Russia. Another problem is that NATO countries are hardly allowed to say anything against the Alliance stationing certain types of equipment on their territory. For example, parts of the missile defence system that would be deployed in Romania and soon also in Poland.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on NATO as a geopolitical project of the US and NATO as having a belligerent agenda against Russia.
NATO is not an instrument of US foreign policy. NATO was founded in 1949 by twelve sovereign nations: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States. It has since grown to 29 Allies who each took an individual and sovereign decision to join this Alliance.
All decisions in NATO are taken by consensus, which means that a decision can only be taken if every single member accepts it. No member of the Alliance can order the deployment of armed forces of other member states.
Moreover, NATO poses no threat to Russia. All Allies reaffirmed at the Brussels Summit that ""the Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.”
Also, in direct response to Russia's use of military force against its neighbours, NATO has deployed four multinational battle-groups to the Baltic States and Poland. These forces are rotational, defensive and proportionate. They cannot compare to the three divisions Russia has established in its Western Military and Southern Military Districts. Before Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, there were no plans to deploy Allied troops to the eastern part of the Alliance.",REAL
159,US AND POLAND CONTINUE SOWING DISCORD BETWEEN BELARUS AND RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Latest U.S. and Polish activities, including speeches of American experts at Minsk conference and an information campaign of subordinated Belarusian media, indicate that they aim at provoking strict Russian countermeasures and pushing it to the conflict with Belarus. Under the pretext of taking part in a dialogue, Americans conduct information operations, targeting the Union State of Belarus and Russia. Americans need to bring as much distrust and discord in Russia-Belarus relations as possible and to do their best in inflaming the situation in Belarus on the eve of the 2020 presidential election. NATO military exercises Defender 2020 means that the large assault force is created in Poland and Lithuania, aimed at Belarus and Russia’s western regions.
DISPROOF
The message is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia and West's attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the West destroyed the USSR and is currently targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, that the Belarusian opposition, civic activists and independent journalists make kill lists for Western security bodies, that Russia saved Belarus from Western bombing like in Yugoslavia, and that the West's only interest in Belarus is to make it anti-Russian.",REAL
160,ZELENSKYY MISSED THE CHANCE TO USE HIS POPULARITY TO CRUSH THE NATIONALISTS,"SUMMARY
Zelenskyy missed his chance when he came to the polls with a huge margin, and he had the opportunity to appeal to the people, the opportunity to appeal to the army, put up his people, and crush the nationalists. Without this, there will be no decision in Ukraine.
DISPROOF
The recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the alleged power of Nationalists in Ukraine and their impact on the state process, and the disintegration of Ukraine with no evidence given.
In 2014, the far-right ‘Right Sector’ (often described as ""ultra-nationalist"" or ""Nazis"" by pro-Kremlin outlets) gained only 1.8% of the votes, far short of the threshold needed to enter Parliament. This demonstrates the attitude and support for far-right nationalist parties in Ukraine.

161,KYIV IS ATTEMPTING TO BLOCK THE NORMANDY FOUR SUMMIT,"SUMMARY
Representatives of the DPR and LPR are convinced, in fact, that Kyiv is blocking the summit of the Normandy Four. The Ukrainian side has already thwarted three attempts to disengage.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Kyiv government sabotaging peace in the Donbas region. See previous cases about the Minsk agreements and the war in Ukraine.
As stated by Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Vadim Pristayko, only after 7 days of peace in the territory can the withdrawal of forces and assets in Zolote and Petrivske begin. According to the daily report by the OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM OSCE) on the 14th October, fewer ceasefire violations in both Donetsk and Luhansk regions were recorded, but these violations were fixed from both sides. The situation is the same with the withdrawal of forces. The SMM OSCE saw weapons in violation of withdrawal lines on both sides of the contact line.
According to the latest daily reports by SMM OSCE, there were no cases of shelling of the civilian population from government-controlled territories. Instead, according to the press service of the Joint Forces Operation, separatists again fired at the site of the disengagement of forces and assets in Zolote.",REAL
164,PENTAGON CALLS TO CONFRONT THE RUSSIAN THREAT IN THE BLACK SEA WITH MORE MISSILES,"SUMMARY
Even more anti-aircraft missiles, exercises and military bases in NATO countries with access to the Black Sea. That’s how the Pentagon calls to confront the Russian threat. The details of this large-scale plan were recently published by the US government analytical centre RAND.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about US presence in Europe and NATO.
The report by the RAND research centre actually says that it is Russia who is destabilising the region by using military force against other countries in the region for the fourth time since 2008.
""Russia is also using informational, economic, energy, and clandestine instruments to advance its goals of transforming the Black Sea, along with the Sea of Azov, into virtual internal waterways, where Russia can have the kind of freedom of action it has achieved in the Caspian Sea. While the Black Sea littoral countries want to protect themselves from Russian hostile interference, domestic political factors, as well as the countries' membership in or level of association with the European Union and NATO, influence the degree of overlap and divergence in their interests"", claims the report.
The RAND report only made recommendations on what a strategy could be to protect the interests of the countries of the Black Sea region, given these threats.
RAND is a nonprofit organisation, nonpartisan, and committed to the public interest, but not the US government analytical centre as it was mentioned by Russian journalists.",REAL

Over the last few years, significant numbers of Estonian working-age people have moved to Western Europe to look for more lucrative jobs. As a result, the country is faced with a sharp decline in workforce.
DISPROOF
No evidence is given to support this claim.

166,UKRAINE’S ATTEMPT TO GET RID OF COMMUNIST SYMBOLS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COVER UP UNRESTRICTED RUSSOPHOBIA,"SUMMARY
Above all Ukrainians are Russophobes. They are trying to employ a campaign on decommunisation to cover up (frankly speaking, it works bad) unrestricted Russophobia in everything. It seems very profitable for Ukraine to neglect its past in exchange for no future.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that Ukraine is a Russophobic country and that decommunisation is directed against Russia.
There is no evidence of this. In fact, Ukraine is not a Russophobic country as is often claimed by the Kremlin media. Ukraine had to react to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the act of aggression by the Russian armed forces in Donbas. It did not ban the Russian language, as is often claimed by the Kremlin, nor did it ban contact between Ukrainians and Russians.
In Ukraine, the law on decommunisation initiated by the Cabinet of Ministers came into force in 2015. The document recognises the communist totalitarian regime of 1917–1991 in Ukraine as criminal and pursuing a policy of state terror. The law condemns two totalitarian ideologies - Communism and Nazism.",REAL
167,UK DENIED ACCESS TO THE SKRIPALS,"SUMMARY
The EU prolonged its sanctions against the persons linked to the Skripals’ poisoning. Theresa May claimed that the Novichok originated from Russia but Porton Down denied this claim. Russia has repeatedly proposed a joint investigation but Britain ignored this and denied access to the Skripals.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on the Skripals' poisoning. The statement contains two disinformation narratives out of the many pushed (see article on EUvsdisinfo here). Firstly, the Porton Down laboratory has not contradicted any statements by the former British Prime Minister, Theresa May. As can be seen from this previous case, British scientists at the Porton Down defence research laboratory were indeed unable to verify the precise source of the Novichok. However, they did not disprove the Russian source of it as claimed. In 2018, Gary Aitkenhead, the chief executive of the government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), stated the following: ""We were able to identify it as Novichok, to identify it was a military-grade nerve agent. We have not verified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific information to the government, who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions that they have come to.” Furthermore, a report from the OPCW confirmed the UK's findings in the Skripal poisoning, specifically the purity of the toxin.
Secondly, regarding access to the Skripals, Yulia Skripal stated in an interview that she was aware of Russian officials’ offers to meet, but that she declined to do so. A similar case can be seen here.",REAL
168,THREE TYPES OF RUSSOPHOBIA ARE TURNING BELARUS INTO ANTI-BELARUS AND ANTI-RUSSIAN STATE,"SUMMARY
The basis of the Russian World idea is a fair society and world order. Russia’s foes are concerned about its prospects because it can potentially result in a post-Soviet reunification. Hence, the key tool of political war against the Russian World is Russophobia, i.e. a hostile attitude and hatred towards any Russian manifestations in the whole post-Soviet space. In Belarus, Russophobia is aimed at radically distorting the national consciousness of Belarusians. Its main tool is a doctrine of Polishness which presents Belarusian history through the lens of Polish-Catholic interests. The objective of the Polishness doctrine is not to turn Belarusians into Poles, although this scenario cannot be ruled out, but rather to change their cultural and civil belonging, to cultivate a hostile attitude towards Russia and the Russian World and to tear Belarus away from Russia. The competing civilisation project can be named the 4th Rzezhpospolita.
Polishness and Belarusianness bring a threat to the integration processes in the post-Soviet space and to Belarus itself. We talk about the threat of transforming Belarus into a Russophobic and anti-Russian country. In Belarus, Russophobia is presented in three formats. First, the openly anti-Russian propaganda of the Association of Belarusian Language and other similar groupings. Second, pro-European parties which hide their pathological hatred of Russia under European values. They always paint Russia in a black light and present it as the source of evil on the planet, their activities are based on U.S. and EU instruments. Third, the Russophobia of Belarusian officials, the most dangerous type of Russophobia. A number of state bodies and universities for humanities are its representatives.
All three types of Russophobia have a common objective: to take away the all-Russian basis of national consciousness from Belarusians, to turn Belarusians into haters of Russia, to create a ground for disrupting the Russian-Belarusian union, to revoke the Treaty on the Union State between Belarus and Russia, and to turn Belarus into anti-Belarus.
DISPROOF
This article represents a mix of conspiracy theories, groundless generalisations and assumptions which aim to discredit the West and Poland in particular, the democratic Belarusian opposition and specific NGOs such as the Association of Belarusian Language. It offers an arbitrary concept of Polishness, makes the preposterous claim that Belarusianness is a threat to Belarus and paints virtually all Belarusian organisations which do not clearly follow pro-Russian policies in any field as Russophobic. The article follows recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Western aggressiveness and anti-Russian and anti-Belarusian activities, the West's attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations, Russophobia in the West and everywhere including in Belarus, and Poland's plans to re-establish an empire at the expense of its Eastern neighbouring countries.
See earlier disinformation messages alleging that Poland has plans to turn Belarus into a vassal, anti-Russian state with Belarus’ western part being an eastern part of a new Polish state, that the West is  targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, that the Belarusian opposition, civic activists and independent journalists make kill lists for Western security bodies, and that the West's only interest in Belarus is to make it anti-Russian.",REAL
169,THE U.S. WILL EASILY BETRAY THE BALTIC STATES AND HAND THEM OVER TO RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
By abandoning Syrian Kurdistan, the U.S. demonstrated that they can betray their allies at any moment just because they are lazy to deal with their problems. The more Poland, the Baltic countries, and other Eastern European fans of American strength will tug uncle Sam’s sleeve, shout about “Russian threat” and demand ever more American tanks, grenade launchers, and special forces, the more probable that Americans will betray and leave them to Russia to deal with.
In fact, Russia is neither interested in Baltic countries nor needs them. They are a godforsaken province, a dual periphery of the West and East. However, the Baltic countries constantly reproduce and attempt to sell the conflict, build their international image at the expense of Russia’s demonization, demand NATO allies an even larger militarization of Russian border, and take West-Russia cooperation as a threat to their interests. Such inadequate allies may drag the U.S. into the entirely unnecessary conflict and force Americans to defend them a thousand miles away from the U.S. shores. Americans do not need this, hence they will easily hand Baltic states over to Russia.
DISPROOF
The publication contains recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the Baltic states and Poland as Russophobic and anti-Russian and the US is an unreliable ally which does not care about the Baltic states. It also aims to discredit the Baltic states by portraying them as insignificant, inadequate, and trouble-making.
The Baltic states are full-fledged NATO members, and the principle of collective defence remains at the very heart of NATO’s founding treaty. Hence in case of an armed attack against them each of the other NATO members will ""assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area,"" Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty stipulates. The principle of collective defence ""remains a unique and enduring principle that binds its members together, committing them to protect each other and setting a spirit of solidarity within the Alliance,"" NATO Website reads.

170,EUROPE CATASTROPHICALLY LACKS GAS,"SUMMARY
Europe catastrophically lacks gas. In addition to gas from the [Nord Stream 2] pipeline, it will be necessary to purchase more and more Russian liquefied gas. The launch of Nord Stream 2 will greatly increase the export of Russian gas to Europe.
DISPROOF
This case is part of the Kremlin's recurring disinformation campaign about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
Europe is not ""catastrophically lacking gas"" - on the contrary, there is enough natural gas supply that prices in Europe have been going down this year. This is because the continent has been flooded with liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a number of suppliers since fall 2018, including the United States. A mild winter in Asia has driven gas prices to a three-year-low level and caused LNG shipments to be redirected to Europe, pushing down the prices. As Polygraph explains, energy experts say LNG has allowed natural gas to become a global commodity that can easily move from one continent to another depending on demand, similar to the way oil is traded.
Moreover, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will not import any new Russian gas to Europe; it will simply divert Gazprom’s current transit through the Ukrainian route to Nord Stream 2. Indeed, about 40 percent of Gazprom's transmission capacity to Europe is not utilized - Gazprom's currently unused export capacity to the EU is almost 100 bcm, which contradicts the claim that constructing a new 55-bcm pipeline is necessary to increase gas imports to the EU.

171,EUROPE REALISED THAT ANTI-RUSSIAN SANCTIONS ARE MEANINGLESS,"SUMMARY
Russia is strengthening its position in the world due to the sanctions campaign, which, in fact, is completely meaningless. There have been so many conversations about the threats that sanctions would bring for Russia, that they will lead to the refusal of its position in Crimea, in Donbas. But nothing has changed: Russia’s positions remained the same. And the sanctions have become some sort of atavism, with no sense. Like a bow on a cake. Nevertheless, the senselessness of sanctions and the inferiority of sanctions for the European economy provoked questions. Therefore, analysts have already started saying: either you, gentlemen of politics, get a result, or maybe you will cancel the sanctions, and Europe will breathe more freely. Europe suffers from sanctions against Russia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that Western sanctions against Russia are unproductive and unjust.
Claims that the sanctions are ineffective are not backed by evidence. In reality, most research supports the view that sanctions, imposed on Russia by the US and EU following the annexation of Crimea and Russian meddling in the US election, have worked as planned, noting the drag they have imposed on Russia’s general economic development since 2014: ""This adverse effect most likely operates by depressing both foreign trade and foreign capital flows into Russia. Russia’s own counter-sanctions have also had a clear negative effect on the welfare of the average Russian household.""
The false narrative about sanctions is often backed by false statistics. For example, the alleged economic growth of two percent does not withstand scrutiny. In 2018, the inflation rate went up and the rouble depreciated 20% against the dollar.
The sanctions are not an ""anti-Russian policy"" but were introduced after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the downing of the Malaysian passenger plane MH17. The latest decision on a six-month extension of EU sanctions against Russian was taken on the 12th of September 2019, lasting until March 2020.

172,"GRETA THUNBERG IS AN ARTIFICIAL PROJECT, BEHIND WHICH THERE ARE SERIOUS RACKETEERS","SUMMARY
Greta Thunberg is an artificial project, behind her there are serious racketeers. Poor girl is being manipulated.
DISPROOF
Greta Thunberg is viciously being attacked by Russian state media. This claim is a conspiracy presented without any evidence. It is recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about international youth protests started by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.
This is also a recurring disinformation narrative about the West exploiting the environmental agenda and climate change topic to do harm to Russia, and that global warming is a ""hoax"" perpetrated by special interest groups like green businesses that stand to benefit from the climate hysteria. In fact, the existence of anthropogenic climate change is a matter of scientific consensus. Only a tiny minority of scientists dispute this consensus: the Earth is warming through the greenhouse effect; human activities - including use of fossil fuels, cutting down rain-forests, and farming livestock - are a major cause of the warming; and, unchecked, this rapid warming presents significant risks to human communities and natural systems. Preventing dangerous consequences of climate change is a key priority for the EU.

173,Fake: Ukrainian Institute of National Memory is engaged in hate speech and incite conflicts,"Ukrainian Institute of National Memory (UINP) continues to be the center of attention of the Russian and pro-Russian sites. Over the years many fakes UINP collected about yourself, and a recent article in the propaganda website News-Front united the majority of them. In addition to standard narratives that the Institute allegedly ""spreads in the country the seeds of discord"", there are also new that Ukrainian soldiers did not die because of the war and because of the fact that ""UINP and similar institutions are cultivated in those people emotions that do not lead to longevity. "" The entire text of the article consists of a set of reports of phishing web UINP:
""It serves as a cover to infiltrate to inside information national anxious journalists manipulators or transfer it to foreign powers"";
""Exonerates not those who are really innocent victims, and those who were justly punished by a Soviet court for the heinous betrayal"";
""Derived from archival documents by fraud creates a pseudo-fake"";
""Their task - to provoke a social bouts of irrational hatred and to maintain it at the proper grade level.""
Separately, it is reported that it is alleged Ukrainian Institute of National Memory is guilty of the death of Ukrainian soldiers as ""cultivate in people the emotions that do not lead to longevity.""
""To make war"" with Russia ""at the Donbass fronts, young people are still more likely to die. A UINP fomenting conflicts on the topic of so-called ""national memory"", is doing everything to peace and joy in the Ukraine will never have been, ""- writes News-Front.
Ukrainian Institute of National Memory is the central body of executive power of Ukraine with its own status. Was created in 2010 under President Viktor Yanukovych, as the research budget structure at the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
Among the main tasks of the Institute declared:
realization of state policy in the field of regeneration and preservation of the Ukrainian people national memory;
perpetuation memory participants Ukrainian liberation movement, military, revolutions, famine victims, repression, etc .;
debunking historical myths;
the formation of the citizens of Ukraine patriotism, national consciousness, active position, and more.
The site of the Institute in the public domain, you can view all the activities that have been implemented over the years of existence UINP.
As for the narrative of the deaths of Ukrainian soldiers, it is important to note that, first of all, the reason that the Ukrainian soldiers die, is a war that Russia spends on the Donbass.
For data on May 7, 2019 (in memory of the dead Book of Ukraine), killing 4125 soldiers. Unfortunately, the numbers are growing almost daily. From military action and civilian clothes killed people of Donbass.
Second, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric condition which occurs, including as a result of repeated stressful situations (when participating in hostilities as well). One of the first manifestations of PTSD in soldiers even recorded in the period of Antiquity. Psychologists say that the manifestations of the disorder - it's kind of a normal reaction of the psyche and the body to the traumatic situation, but not all returned from the war suffering from PTSD or disorders.
In Ukraine, realize the scale of the problem due to the ongoing war and returning veterans who need psychological help. In October 2019 he earned a national, professional line for suicide prevention and support Mental Health LifeLine Ukraine. Former Acting Minister of Health of Ukraine Ulyana Suprun said that the first week of the line 52 received treatment, some people have had suicidal thoughts.
It is also worth noting that for the assessment of World Population Review (WHO data), the top 5 countries in which there was the highest number of suicides in 2018: Lithuania, Russia, Guyana, South Korea and Belarus. Ukraine in the list on the 8th place.",REAL
174,NORWAY REFUSED TO DEPLOY NATO MISSILE DEFENCE ELEMENTS SINCE RUSSIA IS NOT A THREAT,"SUMMARY
In Norway, they ceased to notice the Russian threat. Norway refused to deploy NATO missile defence elements on its territory. It turns out that Russia is not a threat.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, portraying NATO as a threat to peace and NATO threatening Russia. It also claimed that Norway has changed its view on the military situation in the region.
Norwegian defence chief Haakon Bruun-Hanssen believes that Russia would want to blockade Norway in the event of a conflict, meaning Norway must be able to defend itself and keep access open for NATO reinforcements.
Norway's government also announced an increase of 2020 defence budget by $218 million, however, this budget does not include participation in NATO's missile defence system. This does not mean that Norway ceased to notice the Russian threat. As a founding member, Norway has been a long-standing supporter of NATO’s policy of developing a joint missile defence system but opposes merging the system with the wider-ranging US missile defence system. Thus, the new budget says: ""As the result of a broad review of political and security factors, the government has decided that Norway will not consider acquiring sensors or defence missiles which can participate in NATO's missile defence system.""
Norway is on track to achieve NATO's goal of member nations spending 2% of their gross domestic products on defence by 2024.",REAL
175,GREEK CHURCH RECOGNISED UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH AFTER BEING INFLUENCED BY THE U.S.,"SUMMARY
The main reason for this shameful and criminal move of the hierarchs of the Church of Greece was the political pressure of the U.S. authorities. The intervention of the American state in church affairs was unprecedentedly rude in nature, although it was described as a “defence of religious freedom”.
DISPROOF
A conspiracy theory presented without any supporting evidence. Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The process of recognition was initiated by the Orthodox Church of Greece at the beginning on 8 January 2019, when the Permanent Synod of the Church of Greece decided that the issue of recognition would be dealt by the Synod of the Hierarchy of the Church of Greece.
In February, the Synod of the Church decided to appoint two commissions to study the issue. In August, the commissions presented a report and recommended to recognise the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
On 12 October, the primate of the church Ieronymos II of Athens and other hierarchs supported the conclusions and voted for the recognition, stating that “the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has the right to granting autocephaly”.",REAL
176,AMERICANS BUILT MILITARY BASE IN MACEDONIA AND PLAN TO KILL PEOPLE WITH DRONES FROM THERE,"SUMMARY
The Americans built a military base in North Macedonia two years ago. It is one among 1,500 military bases in the world, and was made without an agreement between states but with a deal with just one or two Macedonian politicians. Two years ago, the US army came here and built a drone aircraft runway for their base. The purpose was to enable attacks with the most deadly drones for the purposes of the Americans and NATO in the fights against terrorism in the Middle East or the countries in Africa. Now, with this arrangement, foreign soldiers operating in the base are protected with special laws and the host country has no jurisdiction in punishing them and they are free to commit crimes and genocides. For example, these foreign soldiers can murder and rape, and there will be no legal consequences.
DISPROOF
This story is false and pushing an anti-NATO narrative designed to disrupt Montenegro’s road to NATO membership. Regarding co-operation between the armies of America and North Macedonia, this, in fact, only involved a joint exercise entitled ""Decisive strike"". In 2017, the two armies built the aircraft runway together for the purposes of the exercise in the military training facility ""Krivolak"". The article claims that two people decided to turn Krivolak into an American military base. Macedonia has no signed Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) agreement with any country. This (SOFA) agreement is mandatory if allies wish to build a base within NATO countries.
According to the annual budget of the American Ministry of Defense, there are 500 military bases in the world. None of them are in Macedonia.
North Macedonia is not yet a full member of NATO and thereby the NATO Security Investment Restriction Programme does not cover construction of bases here. This was confirmed in a previous statement made by NATO high officials in May this year as a reply to a fake news story by Russian media Sputnik claiming NATO is building a military base in North Macedonia. However, a NATO military headquarters created in Skopje during the operational period of the NATO-led intervention in Kosovo has since been downsized and transformed into a NATO Liaison Office, which assists with security sector reform and host nation support to the Kosovo Force. A NATO Advisory Team is located within the country's defence ministry.

See here for a similar case trying to spread fear about NATO soldiers as rapists.",REAL

Colour revolutions remain the main instrument of the West in interfering in the affairs of sovereign states. Moreover, the methods of their implementation are constantly evolving, requiring continuous updating of countermeasures.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory presented without evidence. The message implies that any spontaneous disorders and civil uprisings in other states, especially the former Soviet republics, are West-funded ""colour revolutions"".

178,THE WEST ATTEMPTS TO DRAIN RUSSIAN RESOURCES AND WANTS TO HARM RUSSIA-BELARUS RELATIONS,"SUMMARY
The West’s aim is to bring discord in Russian-Belarusian relations, to pull out the countries’ resources on countermeasures instead of taking care of economic development and integration. Although Russia’s collapse would not benefit the U.S., it aims at preventing Russia’s development and distracting its attention towards external problems. The game around Belarus played by Americans is an attempt to provoke distrust and conflicts in Russia-Belarus relations.
DISPROOF
This is conspiracy which is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Western aggressiveness and anti-Russian activities and West's attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations.

179,NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SKRIPAL CASE REVEAL IT FOR THE SHAM IT ALWAYS WAS,"SUMMARY
As more information became available, the United Kingdom government’s version became less and less plausible. In fact, many of the allegations made by the United Kingdom government were downright absurd. It is sufficient to note here that the alleged agent used to protect the Skripals was a highly toxic substance where only minute quantities are required to cause an almost instant death.
The Skripals were said to be infected at Sergei’s home. There has never been a satisfactory explanation of how the pair were infected, yet managed to survive several hours, during which time they travelled, fed ducks in the park, ate a meal, and walked through the city centre. The official version was beyond absurd.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Skripal poisoning claiming that the United Kingdom was never able to prove a “Russian trace” and did not provide detailed evidence of Russia’s involvement.
British police and investigations from the intelligence services have produced hard forensic evidence which was sufficient to charge two Russian nationals, identified as officers of the Russian Military Intelligence, GRU, for the attack on the Skripals.

180,CRIMEA RETURNED TO RUSSIA AFTER A POPULAR REFERENDUM,"SUMMARY
The Republic of Crimea returned to Russia after a popular referendum was held on the peninsula in March 2014, against the backdrop of a severe political crisis that led to a change of power in Ukraine.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on the annexation of Crimea claiming that Crimean citizens chose to join Russia through a legal referendum.
The Crimea did not ""return"" to Russia but was illegally annexed by it. Following the covert invasion by “little green men”, the referendum in Crimea was conducted hastily and at gunpoint, barring impartial observers from entering the peninsula. Therefore, no international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014.
Thirteen members of the United Nations Security Council voted in favour of a resolution declaring the referendum invalid. On the 27th of March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On December 17, 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. On the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the landgrab and continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity.",REAL

Following the analysis several of these have now received a higher classification compared to the earlier analysis. The combined evaluation based on the amount of observations in the area provide a very high level of confidence.
The observation that last autumn was judged to be of the highest level of confidence has been reevaluated. Here additional information have come to light that give this particular observation another explanation, and as such it is not included in the basis for the combined evaluation. Despite this the conclusion remain that through the analysis work it is concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the Swedish internal waters have been violated.
The Swedish Armed Forces does not attribute the violation to any nation.",REAL
189,GEORGE SOROS SEEKS TO DESTABILISE EUROPE,"SUMMARY
George Soros seeks to destabilise Europe by encouraging mass illegal immigration, promoting gender theory and supporting unruly minorities. Soros is doing this because, as a child and adolescent in Europe, he personally suffered and now wants to get revenge on Europe. Soros is also being used by the US deep state to spread these destabilising forces (illegal immigrants, gender theory, unruly minorities) in Europe so that they stay out of the US.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory, reinforcing a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about George Soros.

190,TODAY’S WESTERN MALES ARE FEMINISED SEMI-MEN UNABLE TO PROTECT THEIR WOMEN BEING RAPED BY IMMIGRANTS,"SUMMARY
Charles Bronson was the last American man. Since his death, Western males have become feminised semi-men who are not able to protect their wives, girlfriends, sisters and daughters being raped by immigrants, as happens in Sweden and Germany.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narratives portraying Western societies as decadent and inhabited by feminised men who have lost traditional values and the threat of immigration. The narrative about “threatened values” is adapted to a wide range of topics and typically used to challenge progressive Western attitudes about the rights of women, ethnic and religious minorities and LGBTQ groups, among others. According to this narrative, the “effeminate West” is rotting under the onslaught of decadence, feminism and “political correctness”, while Russia defends traditional family values.
The international human rights law framework prohibits gender stereotypes and stereotyping which undermine the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
A textbook example of how the pro-Kremlin narrative about migrants is promoted is the so-called “Lisa case”, a story of a fake rape.",REAL

196,"GERMAN MISSIONS ABROAD ARE UNDER FOREIGN CONTROL AND PRODUCE FAILED, CORRUPT STATES","SUMMARY
The Bundeswehr fights thousands of kilometres away from its own borders, under foreign control. And mostly with devastating consequences, even for Germany. Whether Afghanistan or Kosovo, in the end Germany gets a failed, corrupt quasi-state as a mortgage that exports poverty refugees, drugs and criminals. And the USA? They get new US bases abroad.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about German-Western relations, that Germany is not sovereign or governed by ""foreign control"", and disinformation about German foreign missions.
Pro-Kremlin outlets often use this disinformation narrative about different countries being under the American thumb - see other examples here. Germany is an independent and sovereign country and is not dependent on the United States of America in terms of foreign policy making and therefore it is a conspiracy theory presented without any evidence.  Germany and the US have close partner relations of two sovereign and independent countries.
The claims made about German foreign missions in Kosovo (KFOR) and Afghanistan (Resolute Support) are squandering and false. German missions abroad contribute to the long-term stabilisation of Kosovo and Afghanistan. Significant steps have already been taken to strengthen the security structures on the ground.
According to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the number of asylum applications in Germany is declining in 2019. This trend has continued since 2015, since a gradual reduction in the number of refugees has been recorded in Germany. An excerpt from the Federal Office's current statistics for September 2019 (page 11 of 19).
In the month under review, September 2019, 13,321 asylum procedures were decided by the Federal Office. Most decisions were made for Syria (3,370), Iraq (1,346) and Afghanistan (1,000). Compared to the previous month (15,040 decisions), the number of decisions fell by 11.4%. Compared to the previous year (September 2018: 16,008 decisions), the number of decisions on asylum applications fell by 16.8%.

197,RUSSOPHOBIA AS WESTERN VALUES: BALTIC STATES’ POLICIES EQUALS TO THIRD REICH,"SUMMARY
Russians in the post-Soviet countries have become hostages of local ethnocracies. Russian ethnic regions were mostly developed by Russians. Thanks to Russians many people of the Russian empire survived and preserved their national identity. But today local nationalists point at Russians as the main source of evil, openly falsify history, attempt to instil a sense of guilt and the feeling of inferiority on them. The brightest example is Ukraine, where the history of WWII is openly rewritten, Nazis and their accomplices are proclaimed heroes, and everything which has to do with the Russian World is discredited. At the same time, the Ukrainian nation itself was created by the Soviet power and the country’s infrastructure was mainly developed by Russians.
The same processes, at least covertly, take place in a number of other post-Soviet countries, including in Kazakhstan and Belarus. In the Baltic states, they introduce open bans on the use of Russian, on the right to get the education in Russian, and Russians are perceived as “second-class people”, in full accordance with the Third Reich standards. However local political elites are warmly welcomed by the European community. The double standards policy towards Russians has long ago become a business card of the Western elites. For them, Russophobia is often perceived as good manners. Discrimination of Russians in post-Soviet ethnocracies is actively encouraged by the West. Russophobia is turning into a symbol of conformity with the Western system of values and is an important element of the ideological war that the West wages against Russia.
DISPROOF
This is a collection of conspiracies and ungrounded claims aimed to present Russians as victims of a deliberate plot of the West with post-Soviet countries. This is an illustrative example of the recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narrative about ubiquitous Russophobia in the West and post-Soviet countries alike. For background, read our analysis: The “Russophobia” Myth: Appealing to the Lowest Feelings and look at earlier disinformation cases alleging that Russophobia is the main activity of the Latvian state and that Russophobic Lithuania plans to tear Belarus away from Russia by dragging it into the Western energy network.

199,CRIME-INFESTED NO-GO ZONES EXIST IN MULTIPLE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,"SUMMARY
Crime-infested “no-go” zones, where police and businesses are too afraid to venture, exist now in several European countries. Sweden appears to have had it the worst, as major cities in the country, including Stockholm, Malmö and Gothenburg, have such areas.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative linking migrants and asylum seekers in the EU to violent crime.
The report provides no evidence in support of these claims and names no specific European countries aside from Sweden.
There are no such zones in Sweden. The country's Police Authority publishes a biennial report on what it terms ""vulnerable areas"" suffering from elevated rates of crime, poverty, and unemployment, but has made clear ""it is not the case that the police do not go into them."" In 2019, 60 such areas have been identified, with both law enforcement and the media acknowledging ""positive trends"" in their socioeconomic situation.",REAL
200,THE CHURCH OF GREECE ONLY RECOGNISED THE CHURCH OF UKRAINE BECAUSE IT IS DEPENDENT ON WESTERN FINANCIAL SUPPORT,"SUMMARY
The Church of Greece’s decision to recognise the autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine is not a surprise. What else could have been expected from a church that is entirely under the control of the Greek government? Priests in Greece are government officials. And the Church of Greece is literally completely dependent of Western financial and political support. The fact that it received a large number of visits from US officials and the number of “informal” conversations between Ambassador Pyatt and Greek leaders says a lot.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory aimed at undermining support for the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), presented without any evidence. Pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets have frequently and consistently attacked the establishment of an autocephalous Ukrainian Church. There is no factual evidence to suggest that Western support for the Church of Greece forced its decision to recognise the UOC.
In October 2019, the Greek Orthodox Church decided to recognise the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, following the decision by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The latter delivered the so-called tomos of autocephaly to the UOC in January 2019. For more information on the tomos, see here.",REAL
201,LATVIA HAS NO SAY IN NATO THUS THE MONEY SPENT ON NATO IS AN OCCUPATION FEE,"SUMMARY
The President of Latvia offered to share independence lessons with Zelenskyy. But Latvia is not so independent itself. If Latvia was truly independent, it would not have encouraged foreign military bases on its soil. Latvia has no say in NATO and thus, money that Latvia spends on NATO’s presence is, in fact, an occupation fee.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the Baltic states' lost sovereignty and their subordination to the US and NATO
NATO is an organisation of collective defence established under the Washington Treaty. NATO member states make decisions through a consensus. Consensus decision-making is a fundamental principle which has been accepted as the sole basis for decision-making in NATO since the creation of the Alliance. Thus, each member of the alliance has similar say and all of them are involved in decision-making processes.
Member countries make direct and indirect contributions to the costs of running NATO and implementing its policies and activities.
In 2006, NATO Defence Ministers agreed to commit a minimum of two percent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to spendings on defence. The 2% of Latvia's GDP for defence spending is mainly focused on strengthening the national defence capability to enhance combat and response skills of the Armed Forces and National Guard.

202,"BY SUPPORTING EUROMAIDAN, THE EU PROMOTED SIMILAR PROTESTS IN THE EU","SUMMARY
Western politicians must have realised by now that by praising the Ukrainian Euromaidan in 2013, they promoted similar protests in the EU itself. Unhappy EU citizens envied Ukrainians and learnt how to protest from them, particularly given that the Ukrainian coup d’état was named the Revolution of Dignity. A revolutionary fuse and potential in the EU is much larger than in the post-Soviet space. Revolutionary processes in the EU do not need external management, they spark spontaneously from time to time out of deep problems in the Roman-Germanic world. Europe continues to collapse, and the EU, in a pathetic attempt to stop this process by submitting itself to the overseas empire, is crumbling too.
The fatal error of European politicians is to follow their American master and repeat what the U.S. did in Latin America in the last two centuries. “Banana republics” can be created in the centre of Europe, but given the EU’s much softer domestic structure compared to strict federal authority in the U.S., Europe will not stand it. Unhappy with the influx of migrants, Europeans rebelled and followed Kosovo and Ukraine as examples. Now the ashes of burning Catalonia are coming to Europe, which is seemingly about to collapse.
DISPROOF
This article puts forward a number of unfounded parallels and generalisations and contains recurring propaganda pro-Kremlin narratives about the Ukrainian coup d'état, lost sovereignty especially the EU's subordination to the U.S. and the EU's imminent collapse.
The Catalan protests cannot be simply deduced from the events in Kosovo or Ukraine as the article suggests.The recent strike and protests erupted because of the ruling of Spain’s Supreme Court which sentenced nine Catalan pro-independence leaders to jail for sedition.
In Kosovo, there was a civil war, with thousands of casualties and hundreds of thousands of refugees which ended after NATO’s 78-day air campaign against Milosevic’s regime. Since June 1999, NATO has been leading a peace-support operation in Kosovo, the Kosovo Force (KFOR), in accordance with the mandate from United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999). This was followed by a decade of international administration and status negotiations. In 2008, the EU Council stressed that in view of the conflict of the 1990s and the extended period of international administration under Security Council Resolution 1244, Kosovo constituted a sui generis case. The International Court of Justice has stated that the declaration of independence of Kosovo did not violate international law.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim here.
The claim about collapsing EU is not connected to real conditions in Europe. Support for the EU, as shown in the latest Eurobarometer poll, remains at historically high levels. Asked if a referendum was held tomorrow regarding the country's membership of the EU, only 10% of Spaniards said they would vote to leave the EU.

203,UKRAINIAN AUTOCEPHALY IS A TOOL TO SPLIT THE ORTHODOX WORLD,"SUMMARY
The purpose of the conflict between our church [the Russian Orthodox Church] and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, over the so-called Ukrainian autocephaly, is not to acknowledge the schismatics in Ukraine. The purpose is to split the Russian world from the Greek world.
DISPROOF
A conspiracy theory, presented without any evidence. Pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets have frequently attacked the establishment of an autocephalous Ukrainian church.
The Russian Orthodox church decided to break communication with Constantinople after the latter announced that it would “proceed to the granting of autocephaly to the Church of Ukraine”. On 5 January 2019, after the final decision of the synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Patriarch Bartholomew signed the tomos of autocephaly.
In October 2019, the Greek Orthodox Church decided to recognise the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and supported the decision of the Patriarch of Constantinople.",REAL
204,RUSSIA GAVE CRIMEA TO UKRAINE IN THE 80-90S,"SUMMARY
Russia has always given everything to Ukraine, even that which it should not have. The Kremlin transferred Crimea and Sevastopol to Ukraine in the years 80-90s.
DISPROOF
This is a systematic narrative of propaganda that Crimea has always historically belonged to Russia.
The transfer of Crimea and Sevastopol to Ukraine was first officially agreed on 25 January 1954 at a meeting of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee. The members of the Presidium, voting for the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine, took into account objective reasons: “the commonality of the economy, territorial proximity and close economic and cultural ties between the Crimean region and the Ukrainian SSR.” On 19 February 1954, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR confirmed the need for Crimea to join Soviet Ukraine. Legally, the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine ended on 26 April 1954, on the basis of the relevant law of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
After the collapse of the USSR, Russia reaffirmed respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. In particular, the 1997 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine enshrines the recognition of the inviolability of each other’s borders, the absence of discrimination against representatives of each nationality and the desire for cooperation in various fields.",REAL

206,PETRO POROSHENKO LIED ABOUT HIS OWN PROVOCATION IN THE KERCH STRAIT AND THE US SUPPORTED THIS LIE,"SUMMARY
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has lied about the Kerch Strait provocation. And the West has supported this lie.
Poroshenko has lied about the incident in the Kerch Strait: the Russians had nothing to do with it, it is his, Poroshenko’s provocation. And every time he lies, the United States and its allies support this lie.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation on Ukraine and the Azov Sea. No evidence given that the confrontation was a planned provocation by former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. No evidence that the US supported his ""lie"".
On 25 November 2018, border patrol boats belonging to Russia’s FSB security service seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and their crews after shooting at them, wounding several Ukrainian servicemen. Russia argued that they were in Russian waters.
However, a bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, signed in 2003 and ratified by Russia in 2004, governs the use of the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov, which in the treaty are considered to be the “internal waters” of both Russia and Ukraine.
The construction of the Kerch Bridge took place without Ukraine's consent and constitutes a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It has led, in parallel with the militarisation of the Azov Sea, to tougher controls on naval traffic in the strait. The European Union stated that it expects Russia to stop the inspections.",REAL

In the end of the event against Estonia’s “visa arbitrariness” to the members of Young Guard, the activists wrote on the pavement “Estonia. Entry only for those, who have forgotten their history!”.
DISPROOF
On 15th of August, Estonia added four people to the list who are not allowed to enter the Schengen area. While the official reason for this ""visa arbitrariness"" as pro-Kremlin media calls it, is not to be disclosed by the authorities, the media in Estonia has reported that the reason was their cooperation with an NGO called Russian Fellow Compatriots in Europe and participation in the Immortal Regiment march. The Estonian Internal Security Service regularly refers to various NGOs and individuals engaged in propaganda campaigns or subversive actions in Estonia with support from Russia. Propastop has mapped this network of NGOs and individuals.
As for the slogan about forgetting history, pro-Kremlin media has been claiming that Tallinn was liberated and there was no occupation. In reality this was not the case:  ""On September 22, 1944, when the Red Army arrived in Tallinn, the Germans had already left the city. On 18. September, Otto Tief’s Republic of Estonia’s Constitutional Government, which had been formed by Prime Minister Jüri Uluots acting on behalf of the President was in force."" That Estonian Government ""affirmed the juridical continuation of the Republic of Estonia, and it showed that Estonia accepted neither the Soviet occupation nor the 3-year period of German occupation"". The previous example of the 75 year old disinformation narrative about liberation of Tallinn can be seen here.",REAL
208,THE RESULT OF WESTERN REFORMS IN MOLDOVA IS CRIMINAL GROUPS OCCUPYING THE PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE,"SUMMARY
The result of Western reforms is criminal groups occupying the prosecutor’s office. The whole system of Moldovan justice has turned out to be corrupt. And according to the Minister of Justice, “the situation in the prosecutor’s office is very bad; there are, most likely, criminal groups that were covering numerous crimes”.
You see, criminal groups appeared in the Moldovan prosecutor’s office, and it is a hotbed of crime. And all this was the result of previous “reforms” of the justice system. But who led the process and financed it? Washington and Brussels. And inspired, and encouraged.
Grants, cheap loans, financial assistance – this is a West’s long-standing strategy in subordinating other states and establishing control over them.
DISPROOF
Recurring narratives claiming that the US and the EU control state institutions in partner countries and are involved in their internal affairs.
The Republic of Moldova has adopted a strategy for the reform of the justice sector for 2011-2016, the implementation of which was financially supported by the EU and the US with the aim of fighting corruption and ensuring an independent justice system.
On 14 June 2013, the Moldovan Government signed a Financing Agreement with the European Union on the Justice Reform Support Programme, which stipulated that the state budget will receive international assistance worth a total of 60 million euros to support justice reform. Besides the EU, other donors such as the Council of Europe and the United States' Agency for International Development (USAID) made contributions.
On 11 October 2017, the EU announced its decision to cut the budget support programme for justice reforms in Moldova and not to give the last financial contribution under the justice reform programme, which amounted to EUR 28 million. ""The EU has closely observed the reform process and noted that the Moldovan authorities showed insufficient commitment to reforming the justice sector in 2014 and 2015. With insufficient allocation of funds and personnel, the necessary reforms have not been carried out. As a result, progress has not been sufficient,” noted the EU Delegation to Moldova.
In July 2019, the EU announced that it is resuming budget support assistance to Moldova by disbursing €14.54 million to support the implementation of the EU-Moldova free trade agreement, to finance vocational education trainings, and to assist the implementation of the visa liberalisation action plan.

An aggressive information campaign is going on against Russia [by the West]. On its side, Russia doesn’t wage information attacks. It has never done anything bad to anyone in the information field. Russians have simply learned how to respond.
DISPROOF
This claim is in line with the common pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that Russia is innocent and a victim of Western aggression and Russophobia.
There is no campaign of ""informational aggression"" against Russia in Western media. Western media represent a wide range of opinions and do not follow a single editorial policy on any given topic.
There is extensive evidence documenting the Kremlin's efforts to use disinformation as a weapon. Russia's attempts at interfering in democratic processes in the US and Europe have been thoroughly documented. In 2018, to protect its democratic systems and public debates and in view of the 2019 European elections as well as a number of national and local elections, the EU presented an Action Plan against Disinformation to step up efforts to counter disinformation in Europe and beyond. The Action Plan proposes a set of actions that should enable a joint and coordinated EU approach to addressing disinformation, primarily stemming from Russia.
More cases about alleged Western 'Russophobia' see here, here and here.

Most likely, the Ukrainian side wants to get some bonuses ""- quoted« RT on Russian ""another analyst.
The ten-year contract for the transit of gas from Russia to the EU via Ukraine will expire on 31 December this year. The next round of tripartite talks ended in Brussels on October 28. The European side in the person of Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič of the European Commission expressed its disappointment with the results of consultations: the reason for the collapse of talks a senior European official said, is that the Russian side was ""unprepared"". The EU and Ukraine have similar positions on the issue of the contract with Russia. At a meeting of representatives of the EU have offered clear requirements at the process of signing a business agreement with the prescribed deadlines. Also Europe and Ukraine insist on long-term 10-year contract, which is the volume of gas that Russia is committed to providing for the European consumer in transit through the Ukrainian gas transportation system (GTS). The Ukrainian side is ready to sign a new contract on December 17 said Energy and Environment Minister Alexei Orzhel.
""For us it is very important that the European party itself offers these numbers, and the proposal worked out in terms of procedure - as we sign and when we sign. We hope that it will sign a contract until the end of the year and ensure the stability of supplies to the European markets. I think it's very important to have stability of gas sales on the Russian side "", - quotes Orzhel Ukrinform.
An important point that a new contract has to comply with European law, according to which Gazprom is to sign an agreement with an independent Ukrainian gas transport system operator. This will be a separate company, which Naftogaz would no longer have any effect. To this end, the Verkhovna Rada has adopted in the first reading a bill which provides for the transfer of the gas transmission system in the management of the company Main gas pipelines of Ukraine (subordinated to the Ministry of Finance). ""The final adoption of the law will be the fulfillment of the obligations of Ukraine to the Energy Community and the EU and give a serious argument in the course of further negotiations with Russia to work on transparent European conditions"", - emphasized in Naftogaz.
Thus, Ukraine has fulfilled all the requirements in the way of a new agreement. But despite the expiring term of the contract, Gazprom has not yet been provided Ukraine no formal written offer to settle the situation, said the Naftogaz. Moreover, resorting to his usual ""gas blackmail"" is the Russian side. Kremlin requires Ukraine to give up the decision of the Stockholm arbitration, according to which the Russian company should Naftogaz almost $ 2.6 billion (the sum without interest), for neglecting the terms of the previous contract resources transit through Ukrainian gas transportation system. It is on this key issue Naftogaz previously won the case in Gazprom.
""Russia said that Ukraine should abandon the win in the Stockholm arbitration on the $ 3 billion (the amount of a penalty). Russia said that Ukraine should abandon the fines imposed by the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine on ""Gazprom"" because of their abuse of monopoly position. All of this, Ukraine should be done only in order to begin negotiations on transit. If this is not blackmail - what is it then? "", - he emphasized executive director
Naftogaz Yuri Vitrenko, in an interview with ""24 channel"". Its demand Gazprom announced on October 18, stressing that he intends to conclude a new agreement on gas transit with Ukraine only after Kiev refuses its international victory.

The US-led military campaign in Syria has been fighting against ISIS and other Islamic terrorist groups along with the Global Coalition Against Daesh. Background and a similar case can be seen here and here.

DISPROOF
No evidence given to support this claim and a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that either the US or the West is behind the creation of ISIS/Daesh. This message is part of a broader conspiracy theory alleging that the United States and its NATO partners have established many terrorist organisations and control global terrorism.

Crimea became part of Russia again in March 2014 after a referendum held after the coup in Kiev. 96.77 percent of the voters of the Republic of Crimea and 95.6 percent of the residents of Sevastopol voted in favour of unification with Russia. According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the issue of Crimea is closed.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Euromaidan claiming that there was a coup d’état and that that Crimean citizens chose to re-join Russia through a legal referendum.
Euromaidan demonstrations which began in Kyiv in November 2013 and ended in February 2014 was not a coup d’état but was the a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with former President Yanukovych who refused to sign the EU–Ukraine Association Agreement promised for year.
No international body recognises the so-called referendum and held on 16th of March 2014. On the 27th of February 2014, when it was announced, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. A year after the illegal annexation, even the Kremlin admitted that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum.",REAL

No international body has recognised the so-called Crimea referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014. Thirteen members of the United Nations Security Council voted in favour of a resolution declaring the referendum invalid. On the 27th of March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. On the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the landgrab and continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity.",REAL
226,"UKRAINE WON’T JOIN NATO, WON’T GAIN ENTRY TO THE EU","SUMMARY
You continue to tell both yourself and your citizens (Ukraine) that you are joining NATO, that you will enter the EU, that Russia is attacking. And this does not, and will not, happen. This is your parallel reality.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives claiming that the EU and the West, in general, have abandoned Ukraine and that Russia is not involved in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
Ukraine is a priority partner for the European Union, also within the EU's Eastern Partnership initiative. An Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the EU and Ukraine, was negotiated between 2007 and 2011 and signed on 21 March and 27 June 2014. It replaces earlier frameworks for cooperation. The Association Agreement is the main tool for bringing Ukraine and the EU closer together: it promotes deeper political ties, stronger economic links and respect for common values.
Relations between NATO and Ukraine date back to the early 1990s and have since developed into one of the most substantial of NATO’s partnerships. Since 2014, in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, cooperation has been intensified in critical areas.
The international community, including the European Union recognises and condemns clear violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014. ",REAL
227,VIROLOGY LABORATORIES IN UKRAINE ARE TESTING VIRUSES AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THEIR OWN CITIZENS,"SUMMARY
How can virology laboratories appear in a state that develops viruses or chemical weapons, in the interests of other states, by testing on their own citizens? How can this be? There is evidence that this is going on in Ukraine.
DISPROOF
No evidence is given. Conspiracy theory and recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the US developing biological and/or chemical weapons around the world. In fact, such virology laboratories in Ukraine are involved in preventing the risks of complex diseases by pathogens and, together with other similar projects, counteracting bioterrorism.

228,UKRAINE HAS TO REMOVE THE CURATORS FROM THE US AND EU,"SUMMARY
If you (Ukraine) want to negotiate, then remove the curators and overseers from the United States and the European Union and decide what is beneficial for you and what is not.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative undermining the statehood of Ukraine. The message also repeats disinformation narratives about the EU and US' relations with Ukraine.
Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The EU and the US support the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter’s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence.
The relations between the US and Ukraine are bilateral relations between two independent countries. The USA recognised Ukraine as an independent state on 25th December 1991. The US policy is centred on realising and strengthening a stable, democratic, prosperous and free Ukraine, more closely integrated into Europe and Euro-Atlantic structures.",REAL
229,"THE NOTION OF “RUSSIAN INFLUENCE” IN THE US IS AN ABSURD CONSPIRACY THEORY
","SUMMARY
The notion that Russia “controls” the US is absurd. That this conspiracy theory has taken root in the US says a lot about the public’s grip on reality.
With the help of the corporate media, Americans are beginning to see “Russian influence” behind anything that seems to oppose mainstream US foreign and domestic policy. Some polls have claimed that as many as 56% in America believe Russia meddled in the 2016 elections despite a subsequent investigation spanning over 2 years failing to produce any evidence of such meddling.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Robert Mueller's investigation did conclude that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Mueller's report determined that there were ""two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election"". It led to US senators' proposals to extend sanctions on Russia to deter it from further election meddling.
The claim that the report provides no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion is spurious. Gathering evidence of ""collusion"" - which is not a legal concept - fell outside the scope of the investigation. The aim of the probe was not merely to ascertain contacts between the Trump Campaign and Russia-linked individuals during the election period, but to establish whether these interactions were deliberate enough on the part of Trump Campaign officials to sustain charges of conspiracy (p. 2).
The report explicitly identifies ""numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"" (p. 9).",REAL
230,"WHILE EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT SYRIA, NATO PREPARES FOR WAR IN THE HEART OF EUROPE","SUMMARY
The US withdrew its troops from Syria, but is sending its soldiers to Europe to prepare for a war against its geopolitical enemy, Russia. The US troops will take part in the exercises of rapid deployment in Eastern Europe called Atlantic Resolve. Unusually, for the first time, US troops will deploy in the Dutch city of Vlissingen, at a distance of 2,000 km from Moscow.
DISPROOF
This is deliberate misreporting of an article published by Business Insider, which covered the Atlantic Resolve exercises. The original article states that the exercises are part of ""the [US] Army's ongoing efforts to make sure it can get to a fight in Europe if one breaks out"". However, it did not mention any preparations for an upcoming war in Europe, nor Russia as a geopolitical enemy and the distance between Vlissingen and Moscow.
This is part of a recurrent disinformation effort to portray NATO as an ever-expanding, aggressive power against a peaceful Russia. Here you can see other examples of this narrative, such as NATO's never-ending provocations, its attempts to block Moscow in its sphere of influence, the Alliance's permanent targeting of Russia and Belarus, its role as a US subjugation tool for other countries and its unreliability to defend its members or its plans to continue attacking other countries.",REAL
231,THE EU IS ROTTEN AND COUNTRIES ARE LEAVING IT,"SUMMARY
[Boris Johnson] is doing everything to ensure that Britain exits the EU on hard conditions. Well done Johnson! He shows what a rotten union the European Union is. At a certain point, it worked in favour of all European states. Well, if not all, then at least for the main countries. But then they began to expand to Eastern Europe, the Baltics, and now they are dragging in the devil knows who.
Let them go out. Let them show that the European Union is an organisation that is not useful for everyone and that countries are leaving it. By the way, a useful example for Ukraine.
DISPROOF
This message is in line with pro-Kremlin narratives about the disintegration of the EU and Brexit. The report advances the recurring message that the EU is fundamentally broken and disintegrating - also consistent with the narrative of the EU's imminent collapse - and that it lacks supports the support of Member States.
In fact, support for the EU is at historically high levels, as shown in the latest Eurobarometer poll. Moreover, Europeans would predominantly vote to remain in the EU: nearly 7 out of 10 EU citizens said they would vote to stay in the EU if a referendum on membership was to be held in their country. An absolute majority of citizens in 25 Member States hold this view, and a relative majority in the three remaining states (Czech Republic, Italy, and the UK) does as well. Following the 23 June 2016 Brexit referendum, the heads of state of the remaining 27 EU countries stated: “We are determined to remain united and work in the framework of the EU to deal with the challenges of the 21st century and find solutions in the interest of our nations and peoples,"" after the informal meeting on 29th of June 2016.
The EU enlargement process is rigorous and transparent. The EU cannot forcibly enlarge to states that do not desire membership - even if a country is approved for membership, the decision to join is ultimately a sovereign national choice. Currently, there are five candidate countries for EU membership: Albania, the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey. Two further countries - Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo - are considered potential candidates, with a clear prospect of joining the EU in the future.",REAL
232,NEO-NAZIS HAVE AN OUTSIZED INFLUENCE IN UKRAINIAN POLITICS,"SUMMARY
Neo-Nazis have an outsized influence in Ukrainian politics.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative casting Ukraine as a Nazi country.
The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy.
Far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and obtained abysmal results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. During the 2019 election cycle, the far right managed to sustain an even more tremendous failure; the highest-rated nationalist candidate, Ruslan Koshulynskyy, won 1.62% of the vote whereas Svoboda, one of the Kremlin's favourite bogeymen, won 2.16% of the national vote, falling far short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.",REAL
233,WARSAW IS PREPARING EUROMAIDAN SCENARIO FOR BELARUS,"SUMMARY
The Polish role in Maidan was discussed more than once. Warsaw is still playing an active role in the ‘democratisation’ of Ukraine and Belarus: educating opposition politicians, giving away scholarships and Polish cards. In Kyiv, this had a particular outcome – nationalists and descendants of those who organised massacres in Volhynia came to power. However, notwithstanding the lesson learned in Ukraine, Poland keeps supporting Belarusian nationalists and is preparing the opposition to replace Lukashenko.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory which contains recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about Euromaidan protests, West-staged colour revolutions in Belarus and Ukraine as well as nationalists being in power in Ukraine.
The Pole's Card referred to in the article is a document given to ethnic Poles confirming that its holder belongs to the Polish nation. It is not granted only to Ukrainians and Belarusians. A recent legal amendment has granted the right to apply for the document to foreigners of Polish descent from all over the world. In no way this means that Poland was behind Euromaidan or is preparing a colour revolution in Belarus.
More than that, the spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk here.
Ukraine is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests. Far-right groups played a very limited role throughout the Euromaidan, had not initiated the protests, and are not in power in Ukraine.

234,"POLAND THINKS THAT WESTERN UKRAINE, WESTERN BELARUS AND SOUTHWESTERN LITHUANIA BELONG TO THEM","SUMMARY
Poland thinks that western Ukraine, western Belarus and southwestern Lithuania belong to them. The return of the territories to their legal proprietors – the Ukrainians, the Belarusians, and the Lithuanians – by the Soviet authorities in 1939-1945 is, according to Poland, an act of aggression.
DISPROOF
This message is consistent with recurring disinformation narratives about Poland's ''imperial dreams'', aimed at undermining Poland’s relations with its neighbours.
Poland, a NATO member, respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations, including those on its borders. Furthermore, Lithuania and Latvia are NATO members themselves, and their territorial integrity is protected and guaranteed by the NATO Alliance.
See earlier disinformation messages alleging that Poland has plans to turn Belarus into a vassal, anti-Russian state with Belarus’ western part being an eastern part of a new Polish state, that Russia saved Belarus from Western bombing like in Yugoslavia, that the Polish doctrine of IV Rzeczpospolita is part of the US doctrine of global dominance, and that Poland wants to dismember Ukraine and re-establish a Polish empire.",REAL
235,US VERY LIKELY TO DEPLOY BANNED ARMS IN EUROPE TO PROVOKE WEST-RUSSIA TENSIONS,"SUMMARY
There are reasons to assume that the US striking forces, previously banned by the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, are highly likely to be deployed in the Pacific Rim and Europe to provoke tensions. Such a decision will inevitably lead to an arms race, a growth of the conflict potential will increase the probability of incidents.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative casting US and Western foreign policymaking as a series of provocations against the always-benign (but very powerful) Russia.
The claim is unsupported by any evidence and relies on false precision to give the claim a coat of factuality.
Russian officials and state media routinely prophesy oddly specific Western ""provocations"" against Russia which, for reasons unknown, never come to fruition. In 2019 alone, pro-Kremlin outlets said that NATO would kill its own officers to provoke a new conflict in Ukraine; that the UK would use its chemical labs to kill even more Russians; that the US was planning an anti-Russian operation in the Black Sea; that Canada was also planning an anti-Russian operation in the Black Sea; that NATO would intervene in Crimea to rig the Ukrainian presidential election.

236,CRIMEA CHOSE TO BE PART OF RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Crimea became part of Russia, once again, after the March 2014 referendum, with 96,77 percent of the Crimean electorate and 95.6 percent of Sevastopol’s population voting in favour of joining Russia. This came after the toppling of the regime in Ukraine, in February 2014.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal annexation of Crimea.
No international body has recognised the so-called referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government"".

Last April, a report by former US Attorney General Robert Mueller on “Russian intervention” in the 2016 US presidential election concluded that there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow during the elections.

Western countries cannot resent the way Serbia welcomed Putin and Medvedev. The West sends officials of a third rate category, deputies of deputies, to visit Serbia. When Western politicians come to visit, Serbia immediately gets orders. On the contrary, Russia does not give conditions to Serbia.

Recurring narrative painting the West as unreliable in comparison to Russia. Serbia is a sovereign state and not subservient to the EU and NATO, and many high officials from the West have visited it. The last visit happened just a week ago (22nd October 2019) when German Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, Peter Altmaier, visited Belgrade.
The President of the Czech Republic, Miloš Zeman, made a two-day visit to Belgrade in September 2019. French President Emmanuel Macron visited Serbia in July 2019 and an official visit of the Hungarian President, János Áder, also took place in July 2019.

239,US WILL BLACKMAIL BELARUSIAN AUTHORITIES OVER THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT,"SUMMARY
The US will likely start openly blackmailing Belarusian authorities over the nuclear power plant. Their ultimatum will demand that Belarus either shuts down the station or imports nuclear fuel from the U.S.
The U.S. will use the Belarusian NPP as a political tool for blackmailing and pressing Lukashenka. If he does not comply with the US’ ultimatum, he will likely face a new package of economic sanctions.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory about the Belarusian nuclear power plant in Astravets and the US presence in Europe.
US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Rita Baranwal has indeed said that “in the future, American fuel suppliers could partly supply fuel” to Belarusian NPP which “is already being done at some power plants around the world.” However the assumption about the upcoming political pressure and introduction of economic sanctions in case of Belarusian denial to import nuclear fuel from the U.S. is groundless.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Lithuania fights against Belarusian NPP on the orders of Sweden and Finland, Dalia Grybauskaitė's opposition to the NPP is an attempt to hide Lithuania's own failures in nuclear power, that the ""Chernobyl"" series aimed to discredit the Belarusian power plant and Belarus-Russia relations and that Latvia plans to buy electricity at Russian border to disrupt Belarusian-Russia relations.",REAL

In Syria the White Helmets stage false chemical attacks, are involved in human organ trafficking and remove the  organs of the people they claimed to save.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it found reasonable grounds to believe that chlorine was used as a weapon in the Douma district of Eastern Ghouta, Syria in April 2018. The OPCW Fact-Finding Mission also confirmed use of chemical weapons in Khan Shaykhun on 4 April 2017.
The UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism found Syria’s Government responsible for the attack in Khan Shaykhun. On April 10 2018, Russia vetoed a U.S.-drafted U.N. Security Council resolution that would have created a new inquiry to ascertain responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In June, the OPCW members granted it power to assign blame for chemical attacks.
The ""White Helmets"" movement originated in Syria in 2012. Volunteers save people from the rubble after bombings, despite the danger of dying themselves as a result of repeated air strikes.

DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that Russia is a peaceful country. Since 1991 Russia was involved in several international conflicts, including intervention in neighboring states, such as Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014.
Many international organisations condemned the Russian occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia; e.g. the OSCE statement and European Parliament's declaration.
It was also Russia that provoked the war in Ukraine. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"".
In fact, there was Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014 - 2019), Insurgency in the North Caucasus (2009 - 2017), War of Dagestan (1999), Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War (2015-2019) etc.",REAL

Georgia and Russia have common history. They stood by each other in good times and bad times[…]. The Georgian language and culture were protected under the USSR.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on Georgian and Russian history, aiming at portraying Russia as a brotherly nation with common Orthodox faith.
In fact, Georgia was forcefully incorporated first into Russian Empire in 1801 and then into the USSR.  In 1801 Russia annexed the Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti. Subsequently, Russia also annexed other kingdoms and principalities of Georgia. In 1811 Russian Empire abolished the autocephaly of the Georgian church.
In 1921 Red Army entered Georgia and sovereign, democratic republic of Georgia was demolished. In the second decade of the 20th century, the Bolsheviks shut down more than a thousand churches and abolished church services. During 1921-1953, 1 305 churches were closed, function of one part was changed, the other part was destroyed. Churches were massively remodeled as houses, warehouses or village lodges. In 1978 the Georgian language became threatened, when the Soviet leadership wanted to remove from the Constitution the notion of official state language.

Russia is not going to threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former territories of the Soviet Union.
No one can exclude the possibility that Ukraine will start disintegrating itself, as the regional elites no longer need Kyiv.
Poles, Hungarians, and Romanians have their eye on the Ukrainian territories, which historically were part of Poland, Hungary, and Romania.

247,OPCW SUPPRESSED KEY EVIDENCE IN DOUMA CHEMICAL ATTACK PROBE,"SUMMARY
The OPCW skewed its own investigation of the 2018 chemical weapons incident in Douma, Syria to come to a predetermined decision. The accusation is based on evidence and testimony of an OPCW investigator, who came forward with damning evidence that his own organization had breached its mission.
A member of the panel which questioned the whistleblower also reprinted an OPCW engineering assessment leaked in May 2019. The document rejects the claim that chlorine cylinders, which were used for delivery of the toxic gas in Douma, had been dropped from the air, which was used as a key argument in accusing the Syrian army for the attack.
DISPROOF
The story advances a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative seeking to absolve the Assad regime of responsibility for chemical attacks perpetrated in the course of the Syrian civil war, as well as to undermine the credibility and independence of the OPCW.
The value of the panel's alleged findings is summarized in the following passage from the story itself: ""The panel did not make public the name of the whistleblower or any previously unpublished evidence of the OPCW’s alleged misconduct."" It therefore does nothing to challenge the OPCW's conclusions regarding the Douma incident.
Rather than present actual proof of OPCW wrongdoing, a member of the panel reprinted - for no apparent reason - a technical note by an OPCW engineer (not an investigator) which was leaked from the organisation in May 2019. Similarly, the note does nothing to disprove the OPCW's published findings. See here for our debunk of this claim.",REAL
248,"US ADOPTED HITLER’S HATRED TOWARDS RUSSIA, WAR-PREPARATION SINCE 1945","SUMMARY
According to the Russian military, it is known for a long time that Russia is the main enemy for the United States. The USA has been preparing for a war with Russia since 1945, when it adopted Hitler’s initiative of hatred towards Russia. In 1945, the US and UK developed the “Unthinkable” plan, which assumed the continuation of WWII against Russia with support of the re-armed Wehrmacht troops.
DISPROOF
This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it accuses the West of continuing the anti-Russian policies of Hitler and the Nazis. See other cases covering the “Nazi” accusations against the United States and the EU – here, here and here.
After the end of WWII, the Allied forces implemented the extensive Denazification policy in Western Germany, which resulted in the destruction of the Nazi ideology.
The plan Operation “Unthinkable” was developed in 1945 by the British Armed Forces' Joint Planning Staff (ordered by Winston Churchill) – the United States was not involved in the development of this plan. This document was one of several military scenarios analyzed by the UK Joint Planning Staff, which assumed the aggravation of political and military relations with the USSR after the end of WWII. This scenario should not be perceived as evidence of the UK preparation of a military attack at the USSR as one of its main conclusions was the following: “The existing balance of strength in Central Europe, where the Russians enjoy a superiority of approximately three to one, makes it most unlikely that the Allies could achieve a complete and decisive victory in that area in present circumstances”.",REAL
249,UKRAINIANS DO NOT WANT TO JOIN NATO,"SUMMARY
Ukrainians do not want to join NATO, do not want this [to happen].
DISPROOF
This pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative suggests that Ukrainian pro-European and pro-NATO aspirations are weakening.
This is a manipulative claim since all available recent polls show the highest ever support for NATO membership in Ukraine. A June 2019 joint poll by the Sociological Group Rating and International Republican Institute shows that the number of NATO supporters in Ukraine reached a historical maximum. Today, 53% of Ukraine support accession to NATO; 29% are against.
Somewhat smaller, but still high support for NATO shows a poll conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv “Democratic Initiatives” Foundation. The August 2019 poll revealed that 41% of Ukrainians would like to see Ukraine as a NATO member. In comparison, only 13-16% of Ukrainians, on average, supported accession to NATO before 2014. The report concludes that the attitude towards NATO has changed dramatically after 2014: the number of NATO supporters has tripled.
Polls conducted earlier this year by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology also confirm that support for NATO remains high. In February 2019, 40% of Ukrainian citizens supported Ukraine accession to NATO. Moreover, if on a referendum there were two possible answers - yes and no - 56% would vote ""yes"".",REAL
250,NATO IS LOOKING FOR A REASON TO START MILITARY ACTION AGAINST BELARUS AND RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
The talks about the so called Russian threat are an excuse. Everyone is allegedly worried about Belarus’ domestic policy and its sovereignty as if they really care about Belarus’ problems. In fact, the stationing of U.S. troops in Lithuania means that the U.S. and NATO are looking for a reason to begin military action, and any excuse can be used at the right moment.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory which is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia.
Claims that NATO is preparing an attack on Russia have no basis and have been repeatedly debunked. 
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the West is  targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, that the Belarusian opposition, that NATO is planning to invade Belarus, civic activists and independent journalists make kill lists for Western security bodies, and that NATO/US military exercises in Europe are directed against Russia and Belarus.",REAL
251,"JIT MH17 INVESTIGATION IS DOUBTFUL, BASED ONLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND INTERNET","SUMMARY
In June 2019, the JIT issued a new report, detailing the names of four people suspected of shooting down the Boeing MH17. They are Russians Igor Girkin, Sergei Doubinsky, Oleg Poulatov and Ukrainian Leonid Khartchenko. However, the group refers to questionable sources, including photos and information found in social networks and on the Internet.
The JIT, which does not include Russian experts, refuses to take into consideration documents proving that the missile that shot down the Malaysian Boeing belonged to Ukraine. It also ignores the results of the experiments conducted by the Buk designer, the Almaz-Antei group, which show that the Boeing was shot down from an area that was then controlled by the Ukrainian army.
DISPROOF
Recurring disinformation narrative on MH 17 downing which includes mutually exclusive statements on Russian radar which has not detected any missiles in the area or on the made-in-Ukraine missile. The narrative that Russia was unjustly put apart of the investigation was repeated hundreds of times. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke told a Russian newspaper that ""if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.""
Claims by Buk manufacturer Almaz-Antey were debunked back in 2015 by Bellingcat.
Joint Investigation Team collected forensic evidence from debris, soil samples, stated taped phone conversations and other evidence. Full description on how the investigation was conducted is available here in JIT's report.
JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy. At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation  and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation.

252,LITHUANIA IS A TOTALITARIAN COUNTRY,"SUMMARY
Lithuania is known for uncompromising position concerning all issues, from energy to absolutely wild crimes in the field of human rights. The cases of Paleckis, Mel, and Titov serve as examples. If earlier Lithuania can be considered as an authoritarian country, at present it can be certainly seen as a totalitarian state.
DISPROOF
This message is aimed to discredit Lithuania by putting an absurd claim about the country's totalitarian political regime, based on examples of three recent criminal cases.
Lithuania is a democratic country which protects the rule of law. The most recent Freedom House report qualifies Lithuania as a democracy with aggregate freedom score of 91 out of 100. ""Lithuania is a democracy in which political rights and civil liberties are generally respected,"" the report says.
In March 2019 Yuriy Mel, a former Soviet tank officer, was convicted for war crimes under Soviet rule. In May 2019, the Klaipėda District Court found Viačeslav Titov, a local councillor, guilty of the defamation of the memory of a deceased person, namely Adolfas Ramanauskas-Vanagas, a leader in Lithuania's anti-Soviet resistance. The fine worth of EUR 12,000 issued to Viačeslav Titov was reduced to EUR 10,000 by the Klaipėda Regional Court in October 2019. An unidentified ""network of persons"" and Algirdas Paleckis, a Lithuanian politician, are suspected of having collected information for Russia about investigators and judges involved in the landmark January 13 case, as well as other information. Paleckis has been in custody since October 2018.
See earlier Lithuania-related disinformation cases alleging that Russophobic Lithuania plans to tear Belarus away from Russia by dragging it into the Western energy network, that there is no freedom of speech in Lithuania and other Baltic states, and that Lithuania is a typical dying young democracy.",REAL
253,ALL NATO INFRASTRUCTURE IS AIMED AT ENHANCING THE CAPABILITY FOR ATTACKING RUSSIA AND BELARUS,"SUMMARY
NATO military drills are a demonstration that neither Russia nor Belarus will never be friendly countries for either Vilnius or Washington. Even Lithuania will hardly be so for the U.S., it will rather be cannon fodder for American imperialism. The only viable option for Belarus and Russia is to build a common defensive alliance. It is no coincidence that lately Nasha Niva, TUT.by and other Belarusian media outlets demonstrate weakened Belarus-Russia cooperation. Generally, the whole NATO infrastructure is intended to enhance the capability of attacking Russia and Belarus. It does not necessarily mean that such assault will happen today or tomorrow, but NATO’s better readiness for aggression is there.
DISPROOF
This is a mix of conspiracy theories aimed to discredit the West/US/NATO and independent Belarusian media. It is consistent with recurring propagandist narratives about Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia, West's attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations, the Baltic states' lost sovereignty and their subordination to the US and NATO, and destructive actions of the Belarusian media and opposition guided by the West.
The claim about NATO's plans to wage a war against Russia was addressed on NATO's official website: ""Any claims that NATO is preparing an attack on Russia are absurd."" A number of recent critical publications about Belarus-Russian relations in the independent Belarusian media stem from recent Belarus-Russia disagreements over the integration development and secrecy around the two countries' negotiations over deepened integration.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that NATO buried Latvia’s and Lithuania’s independence and is currently targeting Belarus, that Lithuania is occupied by NATO, that the Belarusian opposition, civic activists and independent journalists make kill lists for Western security bodies, and that the Belarusian opposition is tasked by the West to disrupt Belarusian-Russian integration.",REAL
254,TO JOIN NATO GEORGIA WILL HAVE TO LEGALIZE GAY RELATIONSHIP,"SUMMARY
Jens Stoltenberg noted that NATO is not only a military but a spiritual union. He directly told Georgia that if it doesn’t legalize gay relationships, NATO won’t let it in.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the moral degradation of the West and dictate of Western values. See a recent case: Tbilisi, Baku and Yerevan won't join EU and NATO unless they hold LGBT pride.
Jens Stoltenberg did not issue a statement demanding Georgia to legalize gay relationships.
Legalization of gay marriage is not among requirements for countries aspiring to join NATO. To join the Alliance, nations are expected to respect the values of the North Atlantic Treaty, and to meet certain political, economic and military criteria, set out in the Alliance’s 1995 Study on Enlargement. These criteria include a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; fair treatment of minority populations; a commitment to resolve conflicts peacefully; an ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO operations; and a commitment to democratic civil-military relations and institutions.",REAL
255,PROVOCATION: EU OBSERVERS VIOLATED SOUTH OSSETIA’S BORDER WITH GEORGIA,"SUMMARY
South Ossetian border control officers stopped the patrol of EUMM that violated the republic’s border with Georgia in the vicinity of Tsneilisi populated area. This was a provocation and inadmissible step on the part of the mission members.
DISPROOF
The statement is untrue. On October 24, a patrol of the EUMM was held by armed South Ossetian security actors, while conducting a patrol in the Chorchana-Tsnelisi area. EU Monitoring Mission released a statement noting that the incident ""happened in an area understood to be on Tbilisi-Administered Territory in accordance with the traditional interpretation of the Administrative Boundary Line in that area.""
EUMM mission was deployed immediately following the war between Russia and Georgia in 2008. The mandate is to support the restoration of ordinary life, to prevent a return to hostilities, to build confidence among the conflict parties and to inform about EU policy.

256,THE EU HAS TURNED AWAY FROM UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
European politicians long ago turned their backs on Ukraine and stopped helping the country.
DISPROOF
Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that the European Union is tired of Ukraine and no longer wants to help it.
The EU sees Ukraine as a priority partner. It supports Ukraine in ensuring a stable, prosperous, and democratic future for its citizens, and unequivocally supports Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. Relations between Ukraine and the EU are based on the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, which affirms Ukraine’s independence and inviolability of borders. The Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), is the main tool for bringing Ukraine and the EU closer together, promoting deeper political ties, stronger economic links and respect for common values. Since 2014, the EU and the European Financial Institutions have mobilised a package of more than €15 billion in grants and loans to support Ukraine’s reform process – the biggest support package in the EU’s history. In 2017, the EU approved visa-free travel for Ukrainians. For more information about EU-Ukraine relations, see here.
Far from destabilising Ukraine, the EU and its Member States have been actively engaged in seeking a solution to the conflict caused by Russia's annexation of Crimea and military intervention in eastern Ukraine. France and Germany, along with Ukraine and Russia, belong to the Normandy Four, which is tasked with resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine in cooperation with the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine and the Trilateral Contact Group. The EU supports this process and continues to treat the implementation of the Minsk agreements as an absolute priority for Ukraine’s security: [1] [2].",REAL
257,LITHUANIA IS TEMPORARILY NATO-OCCUPIED TERRITORY RULED BY NON-LITHUANIANS,"SUMMARY
Lithuania and other Baltic states are under temporary occupation by NATO. Lithuania is ruled by a group of people who are not Lithuanians at all. Generally, Lithuania, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are one common territory which was illegally destroyed in 1991 as a result of the defeat in the Cold War. They are part of Russian world, and over time, Lithuania will get back to it too.
DISPROOF
Historic revisionism and recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative undermining the sovereignty of the Baltic States.  
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are sovereign countries and NATO allies.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Lithuania is occupied by NATO, that NATO buried Latvia’s and Lithuania’s independence and is currently targeting Belarus, that the West destroyed the USSR and is currently targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, and that the Baltic States and Ukraine belong to the ’Russian world’.",REAL
258,IT IS ABSURD TO SAY THAT RUSSIA IS PART OF THE CONFLICT IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY

A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine. See a similar case denying Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Eastern Ukraine here, here and here.
The EU condemns the clear violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.",REAL
259,WHITE HELMETS HAVE CLOSE LINKS TO AL-QAEDA AND FALSIFY CHEMICAL ATTACKS EVIDENCE,"SUMMARY
The White Helmets have helped to justify in the media Western interference in the Syrian crisis, but they have also repeatedly contributed to ridicule those media. These media rescuers with close ties to al-Qaeda, have indeed received a financial boost of 4.5 million dollars (4 million euros) from US.
The White Helmets were repeatedly caught spreading misinformation.
In April 2018, images of an alleged chemical attack on a hospital flood social networks. Washington, London, followed by Paris, lead strikes against three sites of “the clandestine chemical arsenal of the Syrian regime” […]. Three sites that were, in fact, under regular surveillance by the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), which found nothing to complain about.
While jihadists are globally defeated in Syria, why are the United States continuing their financial support to the White Helmets?
DISPROOF
Recurrent disinformation narrative. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it found reasonable grounds to believe that chlorine was used as a weapon in the Douma district of Eastern Ghouta, Syria in April 2018. The OPCW Fact-Finding Mission also confirmed use of chemical weapons in Khan Shaykhun on 4 April 2017.
The ""White Helmets"" movement originated in Syria in 2012. Volunteers save people from the rubble after bombings, despite the danger of dying themselves as a result of repeated air strikes.  Activists have documented the use of chemical weapons in Syria, later confirmed by OPCW. Because of this, they have become the target of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign.
Disinformation media routinely accuse White Helmets of “working for terrorists” and giving a biased information to Western media. No evidence is given to support those claims.

260,UKRAINE WANTS TO PRESERVE ITSELF AS AN ANTI-RUSSIAN PROJECT,"SUMMARY
Ukraine needs war, it needs to preserve its anti-Russian project. It won’t survive without it.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Russophobia in Ukraine and Ukraine's statehood.
Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state, not an anti-Russian project. In 1991, Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union. The Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine was adopted on 16 July 1990.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine and Russia established diplomatic relations and signed a number of important treaties. On 31 May 1997, the countries signed a comprehensive Friendship Treaty. As a result, Russia recognised Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. It also recognised that Crimea belongs to Ukraine.
See a similar case: Ukraine is an anti-Russian and anti-European project of the US. ",REAL
261,RAND CORPORATION IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CIA,"SUMMARY
The activities of the RAND Corporation are very dangerous as it develops the most aggressive US expansionist plans, openly promoting American interference into domestic affairs of sovereign countries. The legal form of the RAND (non-profit think-tank) provides it with much broader freedom of actions in comparison to the state institutions – it makes the RAND more dangerous than the CIA and other special services. The recent RAND publications show that the American neoconservative circles (the “hawks”) are ready to destabilize half of the World in order to achieve their version of the US interests.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory, consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about  the secret elites (CIA, Global Government, Soros, etc.), which promote Russophobic policies aimed at the destruction or weakening of Russia.
See examples of similar messages on the secret elites promoting Russophobia here, here and here.
RAND Corporation is a large American non-profit global policy think tank, which is financed by the US government, private corporations, universities, and individual endowments. Besides security and international issues, RAND has numerous areas of expertise, such as civil and criminal justice, education, health, infrastructure, energy, environment, population and regional studies, science and technology, social welfare, etc.
The RAND regularly publishes reports on the military and security aspects of relations with Russia (see the recent report “Extending Russia. Competing from Advantageous Ground”). These reports cannot be called “aggressive expansionist plans” – they are providing an analysis of the ways in which the USA can react to the unfriendly actions of the Russian authorities.",REAL
262,GEORGIAN SNIPERS ADMITTED THAT THEY SHOT AT EUROMAIDAN PROTESTERS IN 2014,"SUMMARY
Georgian snipers confirmed their earlier statement that the shooting on February 20, 2014 during the Euromaidan protest was planned in advance by Ukrainian nationalist politicians Sergei Pashinsky, Andrey Parubiy, Georgian ex-president Mikheil Saakashvili and other leaders of the opposition.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory perpetuation pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the Euromaidan protests.
No evidence is given to prove that “Georgian snipers” were responsible for shooting during the 2014 Euromaidan in Kyiv. Pro-Kremlin disinformation has spread different versions of the identity of the snipers.
For further debunking about recurring disinformation on the Georgian snipers, see StopFake, Myth Detector, The Insider and Polygraph.
The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was a reaction of numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. Read more here.

263,MACRON’S SHUNNING OF RUSSIAN JOURNALISTS IS MODERN-DAY RACISM,"SUMMARY
When President Emmanuel Macron treats the French media with due respect but dismisses their Russian counterparts as mere imitations of Western outlets and “not real journalists,” this constitutes a modern form of racism.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative of Western Russophobia.
In May 2017 as a newly elected president of France Emmanuel Macron said during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin:  ""I have always had an exemplary relationship with foreign journalists, but they have to be journalists. [...] Russia Today and Sputnik were agents of influence and propaganda that spread falsehoods about me and my campaign.""
The French leader was not censuring RT and Sputnik for their Russian origins, but rather due to their active involvement in the extensive, well-documented effort by the Kremlin to influence the outcome of the 2017 French presidential election. See here for a Sputnik article from April 2017 accusing Macron of working for US bankers and ""the gay lobby.""

264,IN 2014 GENOCIDE AGAINST RUSSIANS BEGAN IN UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
The genocide of the Russians in Ukraine began in 2014 with the violation of the rights of  Ukraine’s Russian-speaking population, which led to the referendum in Crimea and the creation of the DNR and the LNR.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about illegal annexation of Crimea, status of the Russian language and war in Ukraine.
Human rights missions that travelled to Ukraine in 2014 did not find evidence that the Russian minority would have been in danger:
1. The Advisory Committee’s Ad hoc Report on the situation of national minorities in Ukraine, adopted on 1 April 2014, Council of Europe;
2. Report on the human rights situation in Ukraine, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 15 June 2014;

266,PENTAGON’S BIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS WORSE THAN ISIS; POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO GEORGIA,"SUMMARY
Pentagon’s biological experiments pose a direct threat to Georgia… Laboratories under the Pentagon’s roof are not charity organizations. The big question is, why Americans spend huge amounts of money on microbiological research in a remote and prosperous country in terms of epidemiology. In accordance with the US legislation, American “researchers” in Georgia can prepare for a bacteriological war with complete impunity. Their activities are far more dangerous than ISIS – for Georgia and the rest of the world.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory and a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Lugar Lab in Georgia and US creating biological weapons encircling and targeting Russia.
Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research is a facility of the National Centre for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC), which became operational in August 2013. The Lugar centre is a top-tiered institution in NCDC’s laboratory network and serves as a reference laboratory of Georgia’s public health system.",REAL
267,BUZZFEED AND BELLINGCAT DELIBERATELY SPREAD ANTI-RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION,"SUMMARY
Buzzfeed and Bellingcat deliberately spread anti-Russian  disinformation. Buzzfeed’s strategy is to spread false information in order to get the mainstream media to discuss an issue, to whip up scandals and influence public opinion. Bellingcat’s “investigations” of cases such as the MH17 downing and the Skripal case have intentionally spread disinformation. Both Buzzfeed and Bellingcat (and The Insider) receive funding from government and non-government organizations that are hostile to Russia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at discrediting Western media.
Both Buzzfeed and Bellingcat  have conducted independent journalistic investigations into the MH17 case and discovered evidence of Russia’s involvement, which was later confirmed by Joint Investigation Team (JIT).

The West justifies its military policy by imagined necessity to contain allegedly aggressive Russian intentions. Against this backdrop, a large-scale information campaign is being conducted to discredit the role of the Union State in regional security and to tear apart brotherly relations of the two countries.
DISPROOF
The message is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia and West's attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the West is targeting the Union State between Belarus and Russia, that the Belarusian opposition, civic activists and independent journalists make kill lists for Western security bodies, that the West attempts to drain Russian resources and wants to harm Russia-Belarus relations, and that the West's only interest in Belarus is to make it anti-Russian.",REAL

271,US AUTHORITIES HAVE PROVIDED NO PROOF THAT MARIA BUTINA VIOLATED THE FOREIGN AGENT LAW,"SUMMARY
US authorities have provided no proof that Maria Butina violated the foreign agent law.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative claiming that Maria Butina was simply a student at a Washington university and was not working for the Russian government.
The FBI investigation provided ample evidence of Butina’s violation of Title 18 of the United States Code, section 951 (Agents of Foreign Governments), which  makes it a criminal offense for any person, other than a diplomatic or consular official or attache, to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without prior notification to the Attorney General, as required by law.
The FBI investigation revealed that Butina worked under the direction of a senior Russian official to cultivate ties with US political groups and highly influential individuals (primarily conservatives) in order to collect information about - and exert influence on - such groups and individuals in the interests of the Russian Federation.
Prosecutors included a memo by Robert Anderson, a 20-year veteran of the FBI specialized in counterintelligence, who assessed that the information provided by Butina to the Russian official who directed her “was of substantial intelligence value to the Russian government and that Russian intelligence services will be able to use this information for years to come in their efforts to spot and assess Americans who may be susceptible to recruitment as foreign intelligence assets”.",REAL
272,"MARIA BUTINA’S CASE IS FABRICATED

Maria Butina was sentenced to 1.5 years in prison for spying, there is something wrong here. If one is a spy, then the punishment must be well over 1.5 years in prison. If one is not a spy, why are they convicted?
Her jokes with a long-time friend living in Russia were portrayed as an attempt to infiltrate into an American organization.
The justice system in America does not exist. Racism flourishes. If Butina was of another nationality, no one would have even looked at her. But she was Russian.
DISPROOF
Maria Butina plead guilty and was convicted for working as a non registered lobby agent of a foreign government, not for espionage. Staying in the US with a student visa, she tried to install ""back channels"" between the Kremlin and conservative political circles in the US, before and after the presidential election in 2016 , in order to improve Russia-US relations.
The FBI special agent's affidavit to the criminal complaint against Butina was based on the searches of two premises, surveillance, and examination of documents, including electronic items.

Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the WW2.
The European Parliament called the war as the bloodiest tragedy of the century, which resulted in millions of victims of authoritarian regimes of fascist Germany and the USSR.

275,UKRAINIAN AUTOCEPHALOUS CHURCH IS A US PROJECT,"SUMMARY
It is no secret that the creation of this schismatic church formation in Ukraine is an American project aimed at undermining the position of the canonical Orthodox Church in Ukraine – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church [of the Moscow Patriarchy].
DISPROOF
A conspiracy theory presented without any evidence. Pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets have frequently attacked the establishment of an autocephalous Ukrainian church.
The Constantinople Patriarchy, not the US, decided to grant the autocephaly to the Ukrainian church. The final decision was made in January 2019, when all members of the Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate signed off the Tomos of autocephaly.

DISPROOF
A conspiracy theory presented without any supporting evidence. Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The process of recognition was initiated by the Orthodox Church of Greece on 8 January 2019, when the Permanent Synod of the Church of Greece decided that the issue of recognition would be dealt by the Synod of the Hierarchy of the Church of Greece.
In February, the Synod of the Church decided to appoint two commissions to study the issue. In August, the commissions presented a report and recommended to recognise the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
On 12 October, the primate of the church Ieronymos II of Athens and other hierarchs supported the conclusions and voted for the recognition, stating that “the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has the right to granting autocephaly”.",REAL

278,LITHUANIA IS A HOSTAGE OF THE AMERICAN INTERESTS IN EASTERN EUROPE,"SUMMARY
The recent training bombing realised by the US B-52 bombers in Lithuania was a clear provocation – Lithuania has become a hostage in process of realisation of the American interests in Eastern Europe.
DISPROOF
This message is part of a broader Kremlin’s disinformation narrative about the Baltic states, which are presented as “vassals”  of US and NATO and used against Russia. See other examples of this narrative here, here and here.
Lithuania is an independent state, which makes sovereign decisions about its foreign and domestic policy.  NATO's increased presence in the Baltic Sea region has been a request of the Baltic states. Following Russia's aggressive actions against Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia requested a greater NATO presence in the region. Lithuanian public support for NATO is currently at a five year high, with 86% of the population in favor of Lithuania’s NATO membership, according to public opinion poll carried out in December 2018 at the request of the Ministry of National Defence. 83% of respondents also approve of NATO allies’ presence on the territory of Lithuania.

279,VOLUNTEERS FROM EASTERN EUROPE HAD A WORKSHOP ON THE ORGANISATION OF “COLOUR REVOLUTIONS”,"SUMMARY
The West has been – for decades – attempting to influence the minds of young people from the former Soviet Republics in order to use them to achieve foreign political goals.
This time, the annual training of young “civic activists” from 15 countries took place in the capital of Moldova. In an atmosphere of strict secrecy and with American money, volunteers were told about strategies to combat power, about the organisation and media support of mass protests. As it turned out, these professionals from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and other Eastern European states shared their experiences of forcibly changing the power in their countries and opposing “Russian influence”.

The West has been – for decades – attempting to influence the minds of young people from the former Soviet Republics in order to use them to achieve foreign political goals.
This time, the annual training of young “civic activists” from 15 countries took place in the capital of Moldova.

283,"TODAY IT IS HALLOWEEN, TOMORROW IT’S A RUBBER WOMAN","SUMMARY
Halloween is a completely artificial holiday, which is accepted because it is fashionable in the West. That is the idiocy. Today it is Halloween, and tomorrow it is a rubber woman. This is unnatural, not normal.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about West's moral decay. Read similar cases claiming that Western males are feminised semi-men and the West is lobbying for perversion.
The tradition of Halloween originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honour all saints.
When large numbers of immigrants, including the Irish, went to the United States beginning in the mid 19th century, they took their Halloween customs with them, and in the 20th century, Halloween became one of the principal U.S. holidays, particularly among children.",REAL
284,US HAS NO INTEREST TO SUPPORT GEORGIA’S PROSPERITY,"SUMMARY
The US has no interest to support Georgia’s prosperity. They principally do not care if Georgia fulfills its conditions of [NATO] integration process… And it is not only about Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Former Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen offered Tbilisi to give up on the claim over these territories as if the Article 5 should not cover them.
DISPROOF
Recurring Pro-Kremlin narrative on the US and NATO, which aims at sowing mistrust and nihilism in Georgian society towards the West.
In 2009 the US and Georgia signed a US-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, which advances bilateral cooperation on priority areas, such as defense and security; economic, trade, and energy issues; people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Read more about US-Georgia relations here. US firmly supports Georgia's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. More about the NATO/US military assistance to Georgia can be found here.
As for the narrative about Rasmussen, this is a manipulative interpretation of the former NATO Secretary General's statements. Speaking at the 5th Tbilisi International Conference co-organized by McCain Institute and Economic Policy Research Centre, former NATO Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen said [13:07 - 15:00] that in case of Georgia’s accession to the alliance, it should be discussed internally whether Article 5 covers only the territory that is actually controlled by the Georgian government and applies to the occupied territories only after Georgia restores its jurisdiction there. As an illustration, Rasmussen brought an example of Germany, saying that West Germany joined NATO in 1955, while East Germany became a member of the alliance only in 1990, following German reunification.",REAL
285,RUSSIA DOES NOT INTERFERE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF AFRICAN STATES,"SUMMARY
Moscow does not interfere into politics, social programs and ideology of the internal political life of its customers and partners.
DISPROOF
There is ample evidence of Russia’s involvement in the internal affairs of different states in Africa and the Middle East. For instance, Russian paramilitary organisation Wagner Group has been involved in military conflicts and civil unrest in Africa.
According to Bloomberg, the Wagner Group works in at least 10 African countries, such as Sudan, Central African Republic, Angola, and Zimbabwe. On Madagascar, the Group accompanied the Russian political experts who were advising some of the presidential candidates on general elections in 2018. Wagner Group also provides military assistance in exchange for access to mineral resources.
More on Wagner Group’s involvement is here and here.
Moreover, it is also a fact that Russia is involved in numerous conflicts around the world, from Syria to Ukraine.",REAL
286,"INSTEAD OF KILLING AL BAGHDADI, THE US MAY HAVE EVACUATED HIM","SUMMARY
The claim that the US killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi could be fake, distributed with the intent to solve problems of US domestic and foreign policies.
The timing is suspicious, when the Trump Administration is losing its position in Syria, abandoning Kurdish allies and surrendering to Russia. Russian experts quoted by the Russian agency RiaFan call this operation a carefully planned forgery. The helicopters allegedly involved in the operation couldn’t have arrived unnoticed and terrorists in the area have modern anti-aircraft missiles. It couldn’t have been a stealth operation, so it was obviously staged, which may have included an agreement with the terrorists.
The claim that Al Baghdadi waited his captors to kill himself with a suicide vest is ridiculous, when he could have easily escaped from there. By destroying the house, US troops where simply trying to erase all evidence of the staging, when they could have destroyed it beforehand to kill Al Baghdadi. The US hasn’t presented any video footage to prove the claim. Besides, it doesn’t make sense that they killed Al Baghdadi when he was one of the tools to create ISIS under CIA supervision. Most likely, he was evacuated by the US given the Turkish offensive in northern Syria and the advances of the Syrian army.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory perpetuating a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that the US has created and is supporting terrorist organisations.
Details of the operation to eliminate Al Baghdadi have been confirmed by the Pentagon, the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Iraqi intelligence. Parts of the footage filmed by US troops involved on it will be released “in coming days”, according to US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and president Donald Trump.
The claim that ISIS was created by the CIA is a recurrent Russian narrative which has already been debunked often. In reality, the United States is committed to degrade and destroy this terrorist organisation. You can see other examples of disinformation on alleged US and Western backing for jihadist groups here, here, here and here.",REAL
287,CIVILIANS IN THE FINNISH CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN CARELIA ARE VICTIMS OF GENOCIDE,"SUMMARY
Civilians in the Finnish concentration camps in Russia’s Carelia during WWII are victims of genocide and should ask for a compensation from Finnish authorities.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation message focusing on Finland and Russia's Karelia during the WWII. This time the topic peaked on pro-Kremlin media's agenda in October 2019 after Russia's Security Service FSB released ""secret documents"" about the conditions in the Finnish camps.
The researchers have studied the treatment of civilians detained in the Finnish camps established in the Finnish-occupied Soviet Karelia in WWII, and nothing suggests Finns aimed at a genocide of Russians or Slavic nations. The word genocide is frequently used in pro-Kremlin disinformation, but it seldom corresponds to the actual definition of a genocide.
Recently, the emphasis of the disinformation campaign has been on Sandarmokh, where 7000-9000 victims of Stalin's terror were executed in the Republic of Karelia, Russia, 1937-1938. Hundreds of monuments have been erected in Sandarmokh to commemorate the victims.
To distract audiences from discussing Stalin's era repressions, beginning 2016, a disinformation message started being spread that among the dead were Soviet prisoners of war shot by invading Finns during 1941-44. There is no evidence to support the claim. Read the full debunk for Sandarmokh here.",REAL
288,Fake: Czech President declared Crimea as part of Russia,"A number of Russian and Ukrainian media have published the news that the President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman allegedly publicly declared Crimea as part of Russia, and invited representatives of the pro-Kremlin Crimean Tatar organization at an official event in Prague. In fact, President Zeman made such public statements, while the pro-Kremlin organization of the occupied Crimea actually present at the meeting. Invitation these activists condemned a number of representatives of the Czech authorities. The official representative of the Czech president Jiri Ovchachek also confirmed that Milos Zeman continues to consider the illegal annexation of Crimea. The source of news is the pro-Kremlin Crimean Tatar organization ""Qırım Birligi"", which argues that ""The Russian Federation is seriously intends to solve the problems that have accumulated in the Crimean Tatar people over 70 years have passed from the date of deportation.""
Thus, representatives of the organization ""Qırım Birligi"" Zeman was named ""European politicians who agree with the democratic choice of the citizens of the Crimea"", and published jointly with the Czech president pictures. The Czech news site Lidovky.cz, referring to the President's Speaker Jerzy Ovchacheka, noted that although the above-mentioned organizations and activists attended the event, Milos Zeman continues to consider the illegal annexation of Crimea. Also, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic Tomas Petrichek said in a comment that would not invite such persons to a formal event.
The Ukrainian Embassy in the Czech Republic has expressed protest in connection with an invitation to a reception at Prague Castle representatives ""Kyrym Birligi"".
""We consider such actions as yet another provocation, which aims to legitimization of illegal Russian actions to attempt to annexation of the sovereign territory of Ukraine, as well as the deterioration of Ukrainian-Czech relations"", - said in a statement.
""We hope that officials and authorities of the Czech Republic, where the government, together with the entire civilized world condemned Russia's occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea will be held in the future from any contact with the representatives of the occupying power and its puppet organizations"", - added to the Ukrainian Embassy in Czech Republic.

308,THE EU IS A SERVANT OF US GEOPOLITICS,"SUMMARY
There is the completely overdrawn EU enlargement to the east. We have made ourselves the servants of US geopolitics and are now complaining that nobody wants to take us seriously. Iran nuclear treaty, INF treaty, Ukraine, Syria, Turkey – whatever happens, is determined by the American-Chinese-Russian rivalries. The old continent, Europe, is not asked at all.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about EU-US relations. Pro-Kremlin outlets often use this narrative about different countries being under the American thumb. The trope has been used frequently, with several similar cases in the EU vs Disinfo database: Germany is a vassal of the US; Germany is the executor of US hegemony over Europe; The USA is controlling Europe through occupied Germany; Germany will have to choose between defending Europe's interest and catering to Washington.
The EU maintains partnerships with the world's key players, including emerging powers and regional groups. It seeks to ensure that these relationships are based on mutual interests and benefits. For instance, the EU’s joint foreign and security policy is designed to resolve conflicts and foster international understanding and is based on diplomacy and respect for international rules. Trade, humanitarian aid, and development cooperation also play an important role in the EU's international role.
The EU is in a prime position, when it comes to trade, as the EU is the largest economy in the world. The EU is the world’s largest trading bloc and external trade and investment have played a dynamic role in boosting its economic growth for many decades. Although growth is projected to be slow, the EU remains the largest economy in the world with a GDP per head of €25 000 for its 500 million consumers. The EU is the most open to developing countries. Fuels excluded, the EU imports more from developing countries than the USA, Canada, Japan and China put together. The EU benefits from being one of the most open economies in the world and remains committed to free trade.",REAL
309,THE EU CONDEMNS DEATH PENALTY IN BELARUS BUT DOES NOT DO SO IN RELATION TO THE US OR JAPAN,"SUMMARY
Speaking of the death penalty, the European community which bothers Belarus and Russia, should mind its own business. Only absolute idiots can abolish the death penalty. In Russian, a moratorium on death penalty was introduced by Yeltsin in 1996 and it is not clear for how long the population will tolerate this outrage. At the same time, the EU does not make claims against the U.S. or Japan which keep the death penalty.
DISPROOF
The EU position is unambiguous. The statement that EU remains silent on death penalties in the U.S. or Japan. The EU is equally vocal concerning capital punishment in the U.S., Japan, and elsewhere.
One of the latest examples is the Local EU Statement on the death penalty in the United States and Belarus, which was delivered in September 2019 during the Council of Europe's Meeting of the Committee of Ministers. There is a whole EU-led Action on US Death Row Cases which contains EU letters to US Governors concerning plans to execute individuals.
In July 2018 the European Union Delegation, the Heads of Mission of the EU Member States and the Heads of Mission of Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, issued a joint local statement on executions in Japan where the Japanese government is called to adopt a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing this punishment. In its relations with Japan, the European Parliament is guided by its 2012 resolution on the death penalty in Japan.
The European Union is the leading institutional actor and largest donor in the fight against the death penalty worldwide, the European Commission Website says. The EU holds a strong and principled position against the death penalty in all circumstances and for all cases, in accordance with the EU Strategic Framework and its related Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. The universal abolition of the death penalty is one of the key priorities of its Human Rights external policy. Read more about EU policy on the death penalty.",REAL
310,UKRAINE RECEIVED ITS TERRITORY FROM RUSSIA UNDER VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES,"SUMMARY
The Ukrainians received their (current) territory from Russia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at the revision of Ukrainian history – Ukraine is presented as a historical part of Russia, country without its own history and no tradition of state institutions. See other cases on the alleged territorial claims against Ukraine here and here.
The history of the Ukrainian statehood dates back to the times of the Kievan Rus’ (9-13th centuries), which was the first East Slavic state (which gave birth to numerous Slavic principalities on the territory of present-day Russia). Throughout 13-18th centuries, major parts of the Ukrainian lands were part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Ukrainians have a rich history of independent Cossack states (Zaporozhian Sich), which existed in the 16-18th centuries. The Russian Empire established its control over the largest part of Ukraine only at the end of the 18th century – it means that throughout the major part of its history, the territory of Ukraine did not have any connection to present-day Russia.
Ukraine was proclaimed as an independent state on August 24, 1991. The Ukrainian independence referendum took place on December 1, 1991 - the overwhelming majority of the population (over 90%) voted in favour of independence. Throughout the 1990s, the Russian Federation and Ukraine signed several agreements, which officially acknowledged the inviolability of state borders between two countries (1992 Agreement; 1997 Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty). Moreover, the Russian Federation guaranteed the inviolability of the Ukrainian borders by signing the Memorandum on Security Assurances in connection with Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1994. It is important to remember that in all of its international agreements, Russia recognized the Crimea as part of Ukrainian territory.
In other words, in 1991, Ukraine became an independent sovereign state with internationally-recognized borders - the claim that ""Ukraine received its current territory from Russia"" is not backed by any historical or international document.",REAL
311,NATO MILITARY EXERCISE NEAR BELARUSIAN BORDER IS A THREAT FOR RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Soldiers and officers of the US Army’s 1st division have already begun to arrive in Pabrade training ground in Lithuania. It is located only 10 kilometers from the Belarusian border.
The arc from the Baltic to the Black Sea encircles Russia’s borders. The contingents of the NATO member countries, first of all the US, draw together drop by drop. There has not been such a transfer of US troops to Europe from the continental part of America for quite some time. We consider this as a threat to our borders, a threat to Russia’s security.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on Western attempts to encircle Russia and portraying military exercises as security threats.
The claim that NATO is encircling Russia is one of the myths about NATO. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, less than one-sixteenth (1,215 kilometres), is shared with NATO members. Russia has land borders with 14 countries. Only five of them are NATO members. Outside NATO territory, the Alliance only has a military presence in two places: Kosovo and Afghanistan.
NATO poses no threat to Russia. All Allies reaffirmed at the Brussels Summit that ""the Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia"". NATO is a defensive alliance. Its purpose is to protect the member states. NATO's exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia, Belarus or any other country. NATO does not seek confrontation, but it cannot ignore Russia breaking international rules, undermining stability and security. See more for NATO's response to the crisis in Ukraine and security concerns in Central and Eastern Europe here.

312,IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT UKRAINE WAS NOT GOING TO FULFILL THE MINSK AGREEMENTS,"SUMMARY
The “Minsk agreements” demonstrated to European partners that Russia did not mind helping Ukraine to somehow survive. But Ukraine itself is not able to use the opportunities.The fact that Ukraine is not going to fulfill the Minsk agreements was clear […] from the very beginning.
DISPROOF
Recurring disinformation narrative about the Minsk agreements, portraying Ukraine as a primary violator of the cease-fire. See previous cases about the Minsk agreements and the war in Ukraine.
Overview of the implementation of the Minsk II agreement shows that both parts failed to fulfill the plan. The analysis of the Atlantic Council shows that the majority of violations can be attributed to Russia-backed armed formations. France and Germany expressed the regret on selective interpretation of the Minsk agreements by Russia. In a joint press conference to the United Nations, the ambassadors of France and Germany stated that there's an urgent need to ""a renewed commitment by Russia and all sides to the Minsk Agreements and the Normandy Process.”
According to the reports by the OSCE Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, there are violations of the Minsk agreement on both sides of the conflict. The analysis of the Atlantic Council shows that the majority of violations can be attributed to Russia-backed armed formations.
The claim that Russia wants to help Ukraine does not present the real situation, since it was Russia that provoked a war in Ukraine. For background see here. See another case claiming that the government sabotaging peace in the Donbas region.",REAL
313,"NEITHER TURKEY, NOR THE US HAS ANY INTEREST IN BUILDING PEACE IN SYRIA","SUMMARY
About the war. Can you tell me which is the only country interested in (peace), I do not mean the regional players, building peace in Syria? Maybe Turkey? Of course not. The United States? Of course not. Russia. Only the Russian Federation is interested in peace.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Syrian war.

314,"US PLANS TO CREATE A KURDISH INDEPENDENT STATE WERE THWARTED BY RUSSIA AND TURKEY
","SUMMARY
Russian and Turkish presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan met in Sochi to sign a memorandum about Syria after intense negotiations. The provisions include the deployment of Russian-Syrian forces on the territories previously controlled by the US and Kurdish militias. This historical agreement will put an end to the US attempts to implement a ‘Great Kurdistan’, the creation of a Kurdish independent state on Turkey’s borders.
DISPROOF
The allegations about a US plan to create a ‘Great Kurdistan’ are a conspiracy theory with zero evidence to back it.
There is a long-established conspiracist mindset in Turkey called ‘the Sèvres Syndrome’, well known to political scientists and Turkish observators, which tends to think that Western powers are always plotting to divide Turkey as they did in the Sèvres Treaty in 1920, sometimes allegedly using minorities as a spearhead. One of its most recent expressions is the idea that the West is promoting Kurdish separatism as a way to weaken a resurgent Turkey, a belief reinforced by the support provided by the US military to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Syria. One survey conducted in 2018 showed that “ninety percent [of participants] said that the United States was behind the PKK and YPG [Kurdish armed groups in Turkey and Syria]”.
This fits into the recurrent Russian disinformation narrative of Western powers promoting secessionism to weaken other countries, such as Russia, Ukraine, Syria, Belarus, Venezuela or Mexico.",REAL
315,RUSSIAN LONG-RANGE BOMBERS HAVE NEVER REALIZED BOMBING SIMULATIONS AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES,"SUMMARY
The appearance of American bombers B-52H Stratofortress at the borders of Crimea and imitation of bombing of Crimea has provocative character, and it is the element of information war. The main component in this event is the imitation of bombing of Crimea. The Russian long-range bombers have never allowed themselves such actions.
DISPROOF
This message presents a narrative on aggressive NATO threatening peaceful Russia. Read similar cases alleging that NATO is an instrument of US foreign policy, the USA imposes confrontation with Russia on Europe and NATO is pursuing a real war-preparation policy for Europe.
During the recent years, there has been increased activity of the Russian strategic bombers flying close to the borders of NATO members and other US allies - in many situations, these flights take a form of military provocation. It is a common situation when the Russian strategic bombers openly violate the airspace of sovereign countries (Japan, South Korea, Colombia, etc.). Moreover, there have been cases (confirmed by NATO), that Russian strategic bombers simulated nuclear strikes against other countries – see the case of Sweden.
Regarding the recent flight of the American bombers near Crimea, according to the United States European Command (EUCOM), two B-52H strategic bombers conducted the integration and interoperability training with European allies and partners in the Black Sea region. The EUCOM states that this deployment enhances global stability and security while enabling units to become familiar with the U.S. Air Forces Europe-U.S. Air Forces Africa area of responsibility.",REAL
316,"BLOODSHED LOOMED IN CRIMEA, BUT RUSSIA DIDN’T ALLOW IT.","SUMMARY
Was there bloodshed in Crimea? No, [Russia] didn’t allow it! Did [Russia] allow a conflict to evolve in Syria? No, we didn’t allow it!
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about ""good Russia"" and how there were no killings in Crimea during the illegal annexation. The first victim of Russian aggression in Crimea was a Ukrainian soldier Sergey Kokurin. He was killed by Russian special forces in March 2014.
The other murder during the annexation of Crimea was the killing of the Major of the 10th Saki naval aviation brigade, Stanislav Karachevsky. This soldier died around midnight on 6 April 2014 from two shots in the back from an AK-74 assault rifle. The Crimean garrison military court created by Russia in Simferopol stated that a Russian, Yevgeny Zaitsev, from the Fleet of the Marines of the Black Sea, was guilty of this killing.
Following the covert invasion by “little green men”, the referendum in Crimea was conducted hastily and at gunpoint, barring impartial observers from entering the peninsula. Therefore, no international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014.
It's not right to claim that Russia saved Syria either. There is ample evidence that the Syrian leadership (supported by Russia) is responsible for numerous massacres, bombings and chemical attacks on civilians in Syria. Russian airstrikes on hospitals, water treatment plants and mosques [causing hundreds of civilian deaths] have also been documented. Both militaries have denied the allegation.

Finnish concentration camps in Carelia during WWII: There is proof that some of the Finnish guards were paedophiles raping dying kids
DISPROOF
The article refers to proof but fails to provide the reader with it. The disinformation message consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about lost sovereignty of the  Western moral decay. A collection of earlier paedophilia-related disinformation cases can be seen here.
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation message focusing on Finland and Russia's Carelia during the WWII. This time the topic peaked on pro-Kremlin media's agenda in October 2019 after Russia's Security Service FSB released ""secret documents"" about the conditions in the Finnish camps.
Recently, the emphasis of the disinformation campaign has been on Sandarmokh, where 7000-9000 victims of Stalin's terror were executed in the Republic of Carelia, Russia, 1937-1938. Hundreds of monuments have been erected in Sandarmokh to commemorate the victims.
To distract audiences from discussing Stalin's era repressions, beginning 2016, a disinformation message started being spread that among the dead were Soviet prisoners of war shot by invading Finns during 1941-44. There is no evidence to support the claim. Read the full debunk for Sandarmokh here.",REAL
318,UKRAINE IS BLOCKING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STEINMEIER FORMULA,"SUMMARY
The Ukrainian side still blocking it (Steinmeier formula). There are no prerequisites for Ukraine tomorrow, in a week, a month or later, to implement the formula in Ukrainian legislation.
Zelensky repeats Poroshenko at its worst. He came to power with peaceful slogans. He declared that he was the president of the peace. And the first thing he would do to achieve a peace. More than six months have passed, but there is no order for a ceasefire. Not a single paragraph, even the most basic on breeding and ceasefire by Ukraine, has been implemented.
DISPROOF
Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Kyiv government sabotaging peace in the Donbas region. See previous cases about the Minsk agreements and the war in Ukraine.
Steinmeier's formula calls for elections to be held in the separatist-held territories under Ukrainian legislation and the supervision of the OSCE. The withdrawal of forces is the other step that should be done before the planned elections.  ""By signing on, Ukraine agreed to hold local elections in the Donbas -- but only under Ukrainian law, and only after Russian forces are withdrawn and Ukraine regains control of the state border. There won't be any elections under the barrel of a gun,"" said the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
At the moment, neither Ukraine nor the so-called ""DPR"" and ""LNR"" withdrew its troops. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declares that all issues regarding the format of the deployment of forces in the Donbas are clearly stated in the Minsk agreements, so Ukraine should not discuss it again and cannot provide a withdrawal when the shelling continues.
According to the daily report by the SMM OSCE, the Mission recorded ceasefire violations in both Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but those violations were fixed from both sides. The same situation is with the withdrawal of forces.The SMM OSCE saw weapons in violation of withdrawal lines on both sides of the contact line.

320,"POLISH AUTHORITIES CARRY OUT THE AMERICAN WILL REGARDING LNG, UKRAINE AND BELARUS","SUMMARY
The recent anti-Russian publication of the RAND Corporation (“Extending Russia. Competing from Advantageous Ground”) shows that the United States wants to turn Poland into a tool of fight with the import of Russian gas to Europe and its replacement with the American LNG. The government of the Law and Justice Party is realizing this strategy in a desperate way – purchasing expensive American gas, promoting the US LNG among other countries of the region, and sabotaging investments into pipelines connecting Europe and Russia.
The next sphere mentioned in the RAND Report is the support of the anti-Russian processes taking place in Ukraine – the Report shows that Washington can count on the Warsaw “hawks” regarding this issue.  Finally, Poland can get involved in the process of regime change in Belarus. Both in terms of Ukraine and Belarus, the Polish authorities implement the tasks promoted by the USA in a loyal way.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the US presence in Europe, suggesting that the United States fully controls the foreign, defense and energy policy of Poland. See other examples of this message here, here and here.
The statement that the United States entirely shapes the energy policy of Poland and its foreign policy regarding Ukraine and Belarus is a conspiracy theory; it is also a part of a recurring disinformation narrative which questions any attempts at diversifying energy sources, if this means buying gas from other sources than Russia.
First of all, Poland is a sovereign state, which forms its own foreign and domestic policies.
Secondly, the purchase of the American LNG is a sovereign decision of Poland as it strengthens the energy security of this country.
Thirdly, the Polish policy towards Ukraine and Belarus is not shaped by external forces (USA), but by Polish authorities – Poland is a sovereign state with its own foreign policy, so it does not “promote the American tasks” in Ukraine and Belarus.
RAND Corporation is a large American nonprofit global policy think tank, which is financed by the US government, private corporations, universities, and individual endowments. Besides security and international issues, RAND has numerous areas of expertise, such as civil and criminal justice, education, health, infrastructure, energy, environment, population and regional studies, science and technology, social welfare, etc.
The RAND regularly publishes reports on the military and security aspects of relations with Russia (see the recent report “Extending Russia. Competing from Advantageous Ground”).
The report described in the disinformation message mentions Poland mainly in connection to the Polish LNG facilities (increase in import of the US LNG to the region); increasing US military presence in Eastern and Central Europe (suggestion to deploy more US troops in Poland) and more active manifestation of NATO presence in Poland (military exercises taking place on the territory of this country).",REAL

322,UKRAINE DOESN’T NEED DONBAS,"SUMMARY
From the point of view of disinformation, the reintegration of the Donbas is impossible, because, firstly, the assets that the Donetsk clan had in Kyiv, they were plundered in their pockets. From the point of view of Ukraine, assets in Donetsk itself are no longer interesting. They (Ukraine) don’t need coal. They do not need an industry that is half destroyed. In general, Ukraine does not need Donbas.
DISPROOF
A recurring disinformation narrative that it's impossible to reconnect Donbas with Ukraine, there is no willingness to do it.
On the contrary, the Donbas reintegration strategy is being developed at the state level. During 2015-2019 it was the State Agency of Ukraine on the rehabilitation of the Donbas. The new power in Ukraine is planning to develop the Donbas reintegration plan by 2020.
On 30 October 2019, in Mariupol, the Donetsk region, there will be the ""Unity Forum"" with the President of Ukraine, government and NGOs. The main theme is the returning of Donbas. The purpose of the forum is to establish a dialogue between the public and the authorities in order to overcome the challenges arising from the conflict in Donbas and its consequences. As a result of the event, participants plan to develop a roadmap for change to implement the strategy in the areas prescribed.

328,THE GOAL OF WESTERN SANCTIONS IS TO PUNISH RUSSIANS,"SUMMARY
The goal of Western sanctions is to punish Russia. Will Germany punish Russia? Think about these words. The Germans want to punish the Russians. (Punish) the Russian people, who suffered incomprehensible sacrifices during the liberation of the peoples of Europe, including the Germans, from Hitler’s regime. The Russians, who 30 years ago showed human compassion and accommodated the strong desire of the Germans to live in a unified country.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that Western sanctions against Russia aim to punish or destroy Russia.
In fact, the sanctions from the US and the EU (including Germany) do not aim to punish Russia or the Russian people but were introduced to send a clear signal to the Russian government after Russia's illegal annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula and the downing of the Malaysian passenger plane MH17.
The first round of EU sanctions against Russia was introduced on 17 March 2014. Later, in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in eastern Ukraine, the EU imposed economic sanctions in July 2014 and reinforced them in September 2014.

In 1990 the US government promised the then president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, that the Atlantic Alliance would not expand to the East.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation that NATO had promised that the Alliance would not expand to the East.
Back in 2014, Gorbachev rejected this claim stating that the topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all.
NATO Allies take decisions by consensus and these are recorded. There is no record of any decision to refrain from accepting the Eastern European nations having been taken by NATO. Personal assurances from individual leaders cannot replace Alliance consensus and do not constitute a formal NATO agreement.
In addition, NATO's ""Open Door Policy"" is based on Article 10 of the Alliance's founding document, the North Atlantic Treaty (1949). The Treaty states that NATO membership is open to any ""European state in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.""

High-ranking Polish officials have long ago made clear that Poland’s national strategy is to return its 1939 borders together with local inhabitants. Poland gives Belarus slaps in the face by its activities, including its territorial claims. Numerous statements of Polish president Andrzej Duda about criminal Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and Soviet occupation target Belarus and Ukraine.

This publication contains a disinformation message about Poland's territorial claims towards Belarus and Ukraine, deducting it from Poland's criticism of Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. It fits into recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Poland's plans to take over Belarus and partition eastern neighbours.
Poland respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbouring countries, including Belarus. Claims about Poland's alleged ''imperial dreams'' are part of recurring disinformation narrative, whose aim is to deteriorate Poland’s relations with its neighbours.

331,"UKRAINE WAS CREATED BY JOSEPH STALIN
","SUMMARY
Do you know who created your country? It [Ukraine] was created by Stalin, whom you hate.
DISPROOF
Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the history of Ukraine and Ukrainian statehood.
The history of Ukraine dates back to the times of the Kyivan Rus’ in the IX-XIII centuries. As a nation-state, Ukraine was formed during the XVI-XIX centuries when it was divided by major European states: the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita) and the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires. However, in the middle of the XVII century, parts of Ukraine's territories received independence from Poland and created an independent Cossacks Hetmanate. Later, it signed a military and political cooperation deal with Moscow, which was then used by Russian rulers to deprive Hetmanate of its sovereign rights.
In the early XX century, after the collapse of the Russian empire, the Ukrainian People’s Republic was proclaimed. In Western Ukraine, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Western Ukrainian National Republic was created. On 22 January 1919, the two states signed a Unification Act creating a unified state. Other territories wanted to join the new Ukrainian state, such as Northern Bukovyna and Crimea, and adopted appeals to the government of a unified Ukrainian People’s Republic.

The origins of this NATO scenario comes from a recent report by the American Jamestown Foundation entitled “How to Defend the Baltic States”, published in October 2019.
The report mention that “three Baltic States—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—face powerful Russian forces” and therefore this report comes to “lay out the military units and force posture, along with changes to Alliance command and control, that would be needed to prevail in case Russia was to spark hostilities in the Baltic States”, after it was proven that ""Russian aggression in Chechnya, Georgia, Donbas, Crimea and Syria have proven that military force can be used successfully without eliciting a forceful response from the West"".

No evidence given to support the theory of imminent civil war and coup d’état in the US.
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about an imminent US civil war and/or massive social upheaval and state collapse in the US. Predictions about a new American civil war and a disintegration of the US have been a common pro-Kremlin narrative since the fall of the Soviet Union.

","SUMMARY
The average salary in Chile is 300,000 pesos and one kilogram of bread costs 30.000 pesos. It is impossible to live this way – an insignificant increase in the price of subway tickets caused the people to go out on the streets.
DISPROOF
This disinformation message promotes the idea of a completely unbearable economic situation in Chile.
The available data shows that one kilogram of bread does not cost 30,000 Chilean pesos (36 EUR) - according to two different price-comparison global services (GlobalPrice, Numbeo), one kilogram of bread costs in Chile about 2,000 Chilean pesos (2.45 EUR). The following study shows that one kg of bread in Chile costs even less - 0.95 USD.
The current minimum salary in Chile is 301,000 Chilean pesos (366 EUR). The current average salary in Chile is 405,000 pesos (493 EUR or 550 USD).
Chile continues to be one of the richest countries in Latin America, but also suffers severe income inequality (the worst among the 36 member nations of the OECD), leading to the current protests. From 1991-2005, Chile faced spectacular rates of GDP growth (on average, 4.1% a year).

335,THE MOLDOVAN GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED THE CONSTRUCTION OF US MILITARY TARGETS NEAR TRANSNISTRIA REGION,"SUMMARY
The Moldovan government has earlier approved the construction of US military targets near Bulboaca – a few kilometers from Tiraspol and Bender. Americans invested about two million dollars for modernising this base, intended for the training of special troops. The Pentagon already has one foot in Moldova.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about encircling Russia and US control on Est countries.The Training Center of the National Army - located in Bulboaca, near Transnistria region – was renovated at the beginning of 2019, within the framework of the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI), funded by the U.S. Government, as is confirmed by the Ministry of Defense of Moldova in a informative note sent to the Stopfals.md portal. It is not a ”US military target” on the Moldova territory, built by Americans. The Ministry also noted that there are no foreign military objects and no country builds such targets on the territory of the Republic of Moldova.
”During the period 2017-2019, the Global Initiative for Peacekeeping Operations (GPOI) is carried out at the National Army Training Center. The respective program aims to develop the training and training capabilities of the National Army personnel for participating in peacekeeping operations and modernising the training and logistics infrastructure of the center,” the Ministry of Defense says.
The Republic of Moldova joined GPOI in 2012 with the objective to improve the training conditions for National Army service members deployed to international peacekeeping missions.
Moldova is an sovereign state, as it is set out in the constitution. Moldova has diplomatic relations with the USA since 1991 when the United States recognised Moldova's independence from the USSR. Since then, both states developed many programmes in different areas, aiming to help Moldova strengthen its democratic institutions, increase prosperity, secure its internationally recognized borders.

336,AL BAGHDADI MIGHT HAVE BEEN A US AGENT,"SUMMARY
Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was in the Camp Bucca detention center inside a US base in Iraq for about five years “under the auspices of the United States.” As he was leaving the detention centre, Al-Bahdadid said “see you in New York guys”. This implies that he knew many US officers and soldiers in the detention centre hailed from New York City. There are many question marks about how a terrorist organisation would give allegiance to a leader who had just come out of a US base after five years in detention, and earlier why he had been released without trial, or even not sent to Guantanamo like other terrorists.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory perpetuating a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that the US has created and is supporting terrorist organisations.
Details of the operation to eliminate Al Baghdadi have been confirmed by the Pentagon, the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Iraqi intelligence. Parts of the footage filmed by US troops involved on it has been released, as announced by US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and president Donald Trump.
The claim that ISIS was created by the CIA is a recurrent Russian narrative which has already been debunked often. In reality, the United States is committed to degrade and destroy this terrorist organisation.

337,UKRAINE IS DOING EVERYTHING TO DISRUPT THE TRANSIT OF GAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE US,"SUMMARY
Naftogaz is doing everything to disrupt the talks and to put an end to a new contract.
This strange behaviour forces Russian analysts to suppose that the Ukrainian company is acting against the national interests because of direct instructions from Washington. The latter does not want a competitive European gas market and, therefore, does not need a Ukrainian gas transmission system.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative blaming Ukraine for the disruption of the gas talks between Russia and Ukraine and plans to cut gas transit from Russia to the EU. Mixed in there is another often encountered pro-Kremlin disinformation claim blaming the US for trying to monopolise the EU gas market.
Ukraine has made it clear that it is interested in and ready to continue the transit of gas from Russia to the EU. On 19 September 2019, during the third round of trilateral gas talks between the EU, Ukraine, and Russia, the Ukrainian delegation confirmed its willingness to sign a new contract for the duration of 10 years under the EU law. Ukraine’s Naftogaz handed over a draft interconnection agreement and a draft standard transmission agreement to Gazprom. Naftogaz reaffirmed its willingness to sign a new contract during the fourth round of negotiations held in Brussels on 28 October.
The claim that the U.S. is planning to monopolise the European gas market is an exaggeration. According to Eurostat, Russia was, and remains, the largest supplier of natural gas and petroleum to the EU. Moreover, it has increased its share over the past few years. Whereas in 2017 Russia accounted for 39.3% of all gas imports, in 2018 its share increased to 40.2%. The other large suppliers of natural gas are Norway (35% in 2018), Algeria (11.3%), Qatar (5.8%), and other suppliers – 7.7%. It is the same situation with petroleum where Russia's share is 27.3%; Norway is in second place with 11.2%.
As of 2018-2019, the U.S. is only the third biggest supplier of LNG to Europe with a share of 12.6% of all EU LNG imports. For the U.S., EU is also not the biggest purchaser, since it accounts only for 10% of all U.S. LNG exports. Overall, from August 2018 until April 2019, the EU bought in from the U.S. 10.4 billion cubic metres of gas.

338,THE WEST DREAMS OF TEARING BELARUS APART FROM RUSSIA AND TO ORGANISE A UKRAINE-LIKE SCENARIO,"SUMMARY
All talk about Belarus’ peaceful mission in Europe or about European Belarus are good chances for the West to tear Belarus apart from Russia and to wage a geopolitical war against Russia from Belarusian territory. The US and EU dream about an anti-Russian scenario in Belarus, similar to the one organised in Ukraine in 2014.
DISPROOF
This message is a conspiracy which is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about West-staged colour revolution in Ukraine and plans to do so in Belarus, about Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia, and Western attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations.
The EU has never staged, nor does it intend to stage, a colour revolution in Belarus or any other country. Nothing in the bilateral paths of cooperation suggests that the EU's goal is to make Belarus an anti-Russian country as alleged. Read more about the relations between the EU and Belarus here.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the US and NATO see Belarus only as part of an anti-Russia bastion, the West's only interest in Belarus is to make it anti-Russian, that the EU plans to take over Russia and to ruin Belarus just as it did to Ukraine, and that the West aims at cultivating anti-Russian sentiments in Belarus.",REAL

One of the infamous legal documents approved in Belarus this year was the Information security concept. The concept defines the information sovereignty, which is, in reality, an imposition of artificial Belarusian identity, opposing the Russian. It also brings up Belarusization. This all means that in the information sphere Belarus is not Russia’s ally anymore and not a part of the Union State, but a sovereign country which distances itself from Russia. Hence the concept can become the Information alienation concept.
DISPROOF
This is an illustrative example of a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the all-Russian nation and Russian world/civilization, which presents Belarusian and Ukrainian identities as artificial and unnatural in contrast to all-Russian identity. The ""all-Russian nation"" is an imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Belarusians and Ukrainians, as well as their sovereignty.

341,MASSIVE CYBER-ATTACK IN GEORGIA WAS ORCHESTRATED FROM THE US,"SUMMARY
A massive cyber-attack in Georgia was orchestrated from the US. The famous group in the US launched hybrid warfare against Georgia, with the aim of returning Mikheil Saakashvili to power.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory, with no evidence given to support the claim. It is in line with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about US interference in sovereign countries and the United States' imperialistic global role.
More than 2,000 websites in Georgia were knocked out by a massive cyber-attack on 28 October 2019, with more than 15,000 websites affected in total. The hackers targeted the websites of the President’s administration, common courts, city halls and city councils of Batumi, Kutaisi and Kareli, as well as non-governmental organisations and media outlets. The homepages of the hacked websites were replaced by a photo showing Georgia’s ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili with the caption “I’ll Be Back.” The attack also took two TV stations off the air.
Georgian police are investigating the cyber attack. According to a statement from the Ministry of Interior, the attack could have been carried out from abroad. Cyber experts also agree that the scale and sophistication of the attack would have required significant resources, indicating that it was most likely a state-sponsored attack.

Moscow has repeatedly opposed the strengthening of the alliance by means of giving membership to Georgia and Ukraine. By doing so the alliance contradicts the guarantees given by Western leaders and Russia reserves the right to respond to the aggressive actions of its foreign partners.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on NATO. Also, consistent with the NATO is encircling Russia narrative.
By signing the 1997 Act, Russia committed not to use force or any other method of threat neither against NATO members, nor against any other state. Russia violated the given principles as by the military intervention to Georgia in 2008, as by the illegal annexation of Crimea.
NATO made no promises not to expand into eastern and central Europe back in 1990, which was confirmed by the former president of the Soviet Union Mihail Gorbachev. Back in 2014, Gorbachev said: ""The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all, and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility."" Furthermore, the claim about NATO ""expansion"" misrepresents the process of NATO enlargement. NATO does not ""expand"" but considers the applications of candidate countries which want to join.",REAL
343,"THE PEOPLE OF CRIMEA VOTED FOR UNITY WITH RUSSIA IN A DEMOCRATIC BALLOT
","SUMMARY
Crimea became a Russian region based on the results of a referendum organized by the authorities of the peninsula in March 2014, after overthrowing the rule of Ukrainian President, Viktor Yanukovych, in February of the same year.
Russian leadership has repeatedly stressed that the people of the peninsula voted for unity with Russia in a democratic ballot conducted in accordance with international law. In May 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that the Crimea issue was “permanently closed”.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal annexation of Crimea.
No international body has recognised the so-called referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014, which was organised by self-proclaimed Crimean leadership lacking democratic legitimacy and installed by armed Russian military personnel following the seizure of public buildings.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government"".
On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
The EU's policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity. In March 2019, on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.",REAL
344,"GORBACHEV AND YELTSIN WERE CIA AGENTS, AND THE US EARNED TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS THANKS TO KURAPATY STORY
","SUMMARY
Ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev, a member of the Politburo and Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, were blessed by Margaret Thatcher to undermine socialism. On CIA instructions Yakovlev chaired the campaign on USSR destruction. His campaign included falsification of the alleged secret protocol to Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Katyn tragedy, both based on Goebbels fakes. Boris Yeltsin, first Russia’s president, was a CIA agent too. He appointed CIA officers to each Russian ministry, destroyed Russian industry and agriculture, science, education, and health care system, and inflicted larger damage on Russia than Hitler’s or Napoleon’s occupations taken together.
Belarusian politician Zianon Pazniak has been a CIA agent too. His mission was to invent the Kurapaty story and to assign the crimes by Hitler’s followers to Belarusian people and USSR’s NKVD, thus contributing to USSR’s destruction. It allowed Americans to benefit thanks to USSR resources and technologies for trillions of US dollars. Present-time impoverished people and great Russian losses are a consequence of Pazniak’s activities.
DISPROOF
This publication is a mix of conspiracies and groundless allegations which aim to present the USSR's collapse as a plot of CIA agents among Soviet authorities, to put a blame for socio-economic difficulties in Russia on the West whose agent Boris Yeltsin allegedly was, to put in question the existence of secret protocols to Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and mass political killings by NKVD including in Minsk and Katyn. It generally falls into the recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the aggressive West.
Alexander Yakovlev was the first Soviet politician to acknowledge the existence of the secret protocols of the 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with Nazi Germany. However, their authenticity is well proven and cannot be considered Goebbels’s fake as alleged. The same is true for Katyn massacre, a series of mass executions of about 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia carried out by the Soviet Union, specifically the Soviet secret police, the NKVD in April and May 1940.
Kurapaty is an area on the outskirts of Minsk, where at least 30,000 people (according to some estimates, up to 250,000 people) were executed for political reasons by the NKVD, in the period between 1937 and 1941. Zianon Pazniak was a Belarusian historian who discovered undocumented mass graves on the outskirts of Minsk in 1988 and alleged that it was the site of mass executions by NKVD. The discovery gave an added momentum to pro-independence movement in Belarus. The version about the Soviet NKVD massacre was repeatedly confirmed by the Soviet and Belarusian official investigations.

348,NATO TRIES TO ACHIEVE SECURITY THROUGH VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS,"SUMMARY
An agreement with Russia is in the interest of the EU and it has a strong impact on the European’s level of life. NATO also needs such an agreement with Russia as it will provide peace. At the same time, there is only talks about security, not peace. And in the case of NATO, they tend to achieve security through very aggressive actions.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, portraying NATO as a threat to global peace because it has an aggressive agenda. NATO exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia – or any other country. The claim that NATO is encircling or threatening Russia is one of the myths about this organisation.
NATO regularly updates the military requirements for civilian infrastructure, at a time when there are increased challenges to security. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the Readiness Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defence and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment.

349,THE RUSSOPHOBIC BALTICS HAVE NO CHANCE TO OVERCOME CESSATION OF EU FUNDING,"SUMMARY
The Russophobic regime of the Baltic countries is implementing policy that deprives them from opportunities to profit from trade relations with Russia. This leaves them without a chance to overcome the consequences of the cessation of funding from the EU, which ends in 2020 and overcoming the demographic catastrophe due to the use of Russian resources.
The demographic catastrophe means that from these countries the population is scattered across Ireland, England and other parts of Europe to work as hairdressers and carers.
DISPROOF
The pro-Kremlin media uses the Russophobia claim systematically on the Baltic states, but also on Belarus, and Ukraine.
Sanctions were introduced after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the downing of the Malaysian passenger plane MH17. The latest decision on a six-month extension of EU sanctions against Russian was taken on the 12th of September 2019, lasting until March 2020. Estonia's policies towards Russia are not limited to sanctions. The Estonian President, Kersti Kaljulaid, met Vladimir Putin in Russia in April 2019 and has invited him to visit Estonia.
The EU budget for 2021-2027 is still in the negotiation phase, but the European Comission has indeed proposed a 24% cut for cohesion policy for Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Lithuania. However, when all the funds foreseen by the proposal are combined, the reduction for Estonia would be from 3,5 billion euros to 3,3 billion euros. As ""individual Member State’s allocation cannot be less than 76 % of what it received in the 2014-2020 period,"" there will be no ""cessation"" of the EU funds.
The demographic catastrophe narrative is aimed to ridicule the Baltic states by exacerbating the demographic decline that they face. In fact, many other eastern European countries experience a population decline, including Russia. See cases alleging that the Baltic states are dying because they chose not to be with Russia, the Baltics will be inhabited by people from Africa, and that Lithuania will be depopulated in 20 years, and that decaying Latvia and Lithuania envy Belarus its strategic relations with Russia.",REAL
350,THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION COMES TO DESTROY THE TRADITIONAL ARMENIAN FAMILY,"SUMMARY
The Istanbul Convention comes to destroy our traditional family. The purpose of the Istanbul Convention is not to prevent violence against women. It is a lie; it is aimed at protecting the LGBT community. They want to bring satanism, an abomination. All this is unacceptable. This is the final stage of the genocide. We’re not going to give up our country to the devils.
DISPROOF
This message is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the morally corrupt West and threatened traditional values plus the West as a threat to and promoter of sodomy and satanism.
The Istanbul Convention (the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence) is a treaty of the Council of Europe that opens the path for creating a legal framework at pan-European level to protect women against all forms of violence, and prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence.
The Armenian Ministry of Justice clarifies that the Convention does not threaten Armenia's traditional values. The Convention only states that traditions, cultures and religion cannot justify violence against women. In addition, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe provided an opinion, that ""there are no provisions in that Convention that could be said to “contradict” the Constitution of Armenia"".

351,GUERILLA WARFARE AND COMPLETE DISINTEGRATION ARE COMING TO THE US-CONTROLLED UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
Recently the confrontation between president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and minister of interior Arsen Avakov, represented by Ukrainian national battalions, has entered a new phase. Negativity is accumulated, the dialogue is avoided by the sides, a formation of an enemy image are already there. Guerilla warfare and subversive acts are coming, and any accident can provoke a new coup which will give a start to a new stage of Ukraine’s disintegration.
The entry of Zelenskyy in power became a catalyst of conflicts between Ukrainian elites. They will result in Ukraine’s collapse, because even the US – and its embassy plays a colonial role in Ukraine – will not be able to restrain the conflict, given that Ukrainian elites copy the split between American elites. At the same time, the US will not allow either Zelenskyy or Avakov to be destroyed. Hence the conflict will be developing cyclically until Ukraine’s complete disintegration.
DISPROOF
This publication represents a mix of conspiracies and groundless allegations aimed to discredit Ukraine, claiming that the country is resigned to a bleak future and imminent collapse. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Ukraine's disintegration and imminent collapse and Ukraine as a puppet state controlled by the US.
Ukraine is a sovereign state. Neither the US nor the EU countries control Ukraine. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by most of the free world but were violated by Russia in 2014.
It was reported that Zelenskyy and Avakov had working disagreements, however, their scope and possible consequences are groundlessly exaggerated in the publication.

352,POST-MODERN FEMINISM IN THE WEST IS LEADING TO THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF MEN,"SUMMARY
Post-modern feminism in the West does not lead to the liberation of women, but rather to the total destruction of men. In Western post-modern societies, women seek total power and are losing their real nature, while men are being emasculated and are disappearing.
DISPROOF
Gender stereotypes and recurring pro-Kremlin narrative portraying Western societies as decadent, having lost their traditional values and breaking down under the weight of feminism. This disinformation message wrongly equates the concepts of feminism with the idea that women are trying to “take the place” of men.
The narrative about the erosion of traditional values in Western societies is commonly used to challenge progressive Western attitudes about the rights of women, ethnic and religious minorities, and LGBTQ groups. According to this narrative, the “effeminate West” is rotting under the onslaught of decadence, feminism and “political correctness”, while Russia embodies traditional family and paternal values.

Recurring pro-Kremlin conspiracy theory painting the White Helmets as terrorists and shifting blame for chemical attacks in Syria away from the Assad regime.
The White Helmets are a staple topic of pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on the Syrian civil war, having already been accused of numerous other provocations and war crimes including organ trafficking; aiding terrorist organizations; staging and/or perpetrating chemical attacks, sometimes with the help of Western intelligence agencies.

It can’t be known whether the US operation to kill Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi really took place. The Syrian radars didn’t register the US aircraft that allegedly participated in the operation. It may be a trick, and Al Baghdadi will reappear with a different name, as a different individual or the whole Islamic State will reproduce itself when it is convenient for its backers, under a different name but with the same ideology and purpose.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory perpetuating a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that the US has created and is supporting terrorist organisations. No evidence is provided to support the claim.
This is part of an emerging Russian disinformation strategy to raise doubts about the death of Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. Details of the operation to eliminate Al Baghdadi have been confirmed by the Pentagon, the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Iraqi intelligence. Parts of the footage filmed by US troops involved in the operation were recently released by the Pentagon.

355,POLAND IS LOSING ITS INDEPENDENCE,"SUMMARY
The Polish government is submissive not only to its main ally (or even a hegemon) – the United States but also to much smaller countries such as Israel. The evidence for this statement is the recent anti-Iranian conference in Warsaw, which was in reality organized by the USA and Israel. Polish independence is weakening, or it has already been completely liquidated.
DISPROOF
A common pro-Kremlin narrative on the “lost sovereignty” - in the case of Poland, this country is often presented as a “puppet-state” of the United States. The statement that Poland is submissive to the will of the United States or other countries (Israel) is a conspiracy theory. Poland is a sovereign state, which shapes its own foreign and domestic policies.
The Middle East conference in Warsaw took place on February 13-14, 2019 - it was officially organized by Poland and the United States. This event united 43 official delegations (mainly, from the countries of the European Union, Middle East, Middle Asia and North Africa).

356,BELARUS FACES EITHER NORMAL DEVELOPMENT UNDER RUSSIA OR A FORCED POLONIZATION AND ECONOMIC DEVASTATION,"SUMMARY
It is no secret anymore that Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s political regime is quickly advancing towards the West. The policy of turning Belarus into second Ukraine, followed by the entry of Belarus into the sphere of the direct control of Washington, can happen, which will mean Russian loss. The main content of Lukashenka’s course is to impose a Ukrainian-like Belarusian nationalism. There is no other way for Belarus to drift away from Russia.
Generally, a belief that Belarusian ruling elite can preserve real sovereignty is a madness. Belarus can only move to the protectorate status either under the West or Russia. Its present state is temporary and transitional, and it came into existence as a result of the USSR collapse. However nowadays Russia is proceeding with geopolitical and geo-economic expansion, and Belarus will inevitably be pulled back. The story of a province named ‘Belarus’ that broke away from the USSR is just a private Lukashenka’s story. The time has come to make a geopolitical choice.
By becoming Russia’s protectorate Belarus will preserve its economic and cultural identity. In the case of West’s protectorate, Belarus will face economic devastation and forced Polonization by becoming Polish third-class agrarian colony. Under Belarusian sovereignty, the West means a total clean-up of Russian influence and status of anti-Russia.
DISPROOF
This message is based on ungrounded claims and a false dilemma about the direction of Belarus's political development. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about US-controlled Ukraine and Ukraine as a puppet state, about Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia and Polish aggressive intentions in particular, and about Western attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations. By naming Belarus a ""breakaway USSR's province"" the publication is also aimed at discrediting and undermining the Belarusian statehood.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Poland is preparing Euromaidan scenario for Belarus, that Belarus will turn into anti-Russia in case it does not deepen integration with Russia, that the West's only interest in Belarus is to make it anti-Russian, and putting forward a ridiculous false dilemma, claiming that the only possible scenario for Ukraine and Belarus to prevent their descent into Nazism through the politicisation of national clothes is to become a Russian western federal area.",REAL
357,"THE EU IS FED UP WITH UKRAINE, IT INVARIABLY FACES A CIVIL WAR AND COMPLETE DISINTEGRATION","SUMMARY
Ukraine, located between Russian gas-hungry Europe and Russia-supported Donbas, will inevitably become a confederation, i.e. will cease to exist. This process can be named “Putin’s effect.” The environment around Ukraine, created by Putin, is turning Ukraine into a political corpse. There is no good way for Ukraine – it will face a civil war and disintegration, in any case. As it happens in the history of empires, Ukraine choked on Donbas and will become covered in the blood that it spilled in Donbas.
Ukraine was unable to disengage troops in Donbas. The continuation of war is a catastrophe both for Ukraine and Europe. This way Ukraine is pushed to a new Maidan when Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be overthrown by an anti-Kolomoyskiy group of people linked to US Democrats. After this sequence of events, Ukraine-EU relations will reach deadlock.
Europe is already fed up with Ukraine. Zelenskyy is turning German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier into an idiot. Emmanuel Macron is pissed off. Donald Trump requests Zelenskyy to start negotiations with Vladimir Putin, to make concessions and to end a war with Russia which benefits the US Democrats. The Ukrainian conflict makes Trump unable to get Russian support in the US-China struggle. In fact, the West and its analysts forecast that if Ukraine fails to fulfil the ‘Normandy four’ agreements it will continue disintegrating and suffer from a civil war.
DISPROOF
This publication represents a mix of conspiracies and groundless allegations aimed to discredit Ukraine, claiming that the country is resigned to a bleak future, civil war, and imminent collapse. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Ukraine's disintegration and imminent collapse and war in Ukraine.
It also gives a distorted view on the war in Ukraine, presenting Ukraine as imperialistic and the aggressior state towards Donbas, without mentioning the Russia-backed armed formations which violated Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Russia’s involvement in Ukraine is limited to acting as a mediator in the country’s half-decade old civil war, brought on by a Western-backed coup in Kyiv in 2014.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative painting the 2013-14 protests in Kyiv as a coup orchestrated by the West, and alleging that Russia's armed aggression in east Ukraine is a civil war.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim here.
The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014.",REAL
361,THE ESTONIAN GOVERNMENT WARNED RUSSIA WITH A FINAL MILITARY SOLUTION,"SUMMARY
The Estonian government has warned Russia about the threat of a “final military solution to the Russian question” if the “export of the Russian world” continues. “Immediate de-occupation of Crimea, Donbass, Moldova, Armenia, Georgia (the so-called“ Abkhazia ”and the so-called“ South Ossetia ”) is the first and indispensable condition. Russia should also withdraw its troops from Syria.
“After recognizing the tools of aggression by the Russian armed forces as an illegal armed formation and their further disbandment, the second stage will be the a tribunal over military commanders and politicians, negotiations on reparations and so on. Otherwise, Moscow may expect a final solution to the Russian issue by military means,” the Estonians threatened.
DISPROOF
The article is based on a text published on a satirical page. However, the article does not mention this information being satire. Thus, it is evident there is no evidence of Estonia threatening Russia.",REAL
362,"POLAND AND THE BALTIC COUNTRIES ARE THE WESTERN WORLD’S JACKALS WHO CAN PRODUCE A GLOBAL CATASTROPHE
","SUMMARY
The stationing of the US military in Lithuania and preparations for NATO military exercises is partly a response to integration processes between Russia and Belarus. This is a way to pressure Belarusian elites, to scare them, and to put forward the following message: this is not your war, you better raise a white flag and surrender.
Lithuanians, Latvians, and Poles are again playing the role of the Western world’s jackals and could thus again trigger a catastrophe for the whole of humankind.
DISPROOF
This claim is a conspiracy theory aimed at discrediting Poland and the Baltic states and the West as a whole. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about alleged Western aggression and anti-Russian activities, attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations and to counteract the Union State between Belarus and Russia.
NATO is a defensive alliance and does not pose a threat to Russia. Its purpose is to protect its member states. Every country that joins NATO undertakes to uphold its principles and policies, and this includes the commitment that ""the Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia,"" as reaffirmed at the Brussels Summit.

363,"EASTERN PARTNERSHIP IS ABOUT EXTERNAL CONTROL AND DISINTEGRATION, BELARUS IS PART OF THE RUSSIAN WORLD","SUMMARY
From the historical point of view Belarusian history is inseparable from all-Russian history. Belarus has to be in civilizational unity with Russia and the Russian World because Belarus is an integral part of all-Russian civilization. The so-called Euro-integration, Eastern Partnership and other programs of Euro-Atlantic cooperation which are imposed by the West, are unacceptable. Quasi-Euro-integration is based on a geopolitical catastrophe and the policy of external governance thanks to keeping post-Soviet space in the disintegrated state.
DISPROOF
This publication is aimed at discrediting all Western mechanisms of cooperation with Belarus including the Eastern Partnership program and suits into recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about the all-Russian nation and Russian world/civilization and Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia.
The ""all-Russian nation"" is an imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Belarusians and Ukrainians, as well as their sovereignty. Belarus is a well-defined nation-state with a long history; it preserved language, literature and identity, despite foreign rule for long periods.
The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is a joint policy initiative which aims to deepen and strengthen relations between the European Union (EU), its Member States and its six Eastern neighbours: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The Eastern Partnership initiative is a mutually beneficial and constructive platform for countries in the region to build a closer relationship with the EU if they choose to do so. The EU does not demand any of its partners to make a choice between the EU or any other country. The Eastern Partnership stands for good neighbourly relations and respects the individual aspirations and ambitions of each partner country. Read more about the Eastern Partnership and its priorities here.

364,RUSSIA IS NOT A PART IN THE CONFLICT IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
Ukrainian authorities keep calling Russia the “aggressor”. However, the Russian authorities have repeatedly reminded that Moscow is not a party to the conflict. Russia is part of the Normandy process for the Ukrainian settlement, and also participated in the drafting of the Minsk agreements, which aim to put an end to the conflict in the Donbas.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, claiming that Russia is not part of the conflict in Donbas, that Russia has nothing to do with the war in eastern Ukraine and that there is a “civil war” in Donbas.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"".  At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014, NATO leaders condemned in the strongest terms Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine and demanded Russia to stop and withdraw its forces from Ukraine and from the country’s border. NATO leaders also demanded Russia comply with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine.",REAL
365,NAFTOGAZ OF UKRAINE BLACKMAILS RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Instead of meeting Russian Gazprom and starting constructive negotiations, Ukraine’s Naftogaz allegedly continues to blackmail Russia. The parties cannot agree on the details of a new contract for the transit of gas from Russia to the European Union through the Ukrainian gas transportation system due to the destabilising position of Ukraine.
DISPROOF
The ten-year contract for gas transit from Russia to the European Union through the territory of Ukraine expires on 31 December. The latest round of trilateral negotiations ended in Brussels on 28 October. The European side, represented by the Vice President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič, expressed disappointment with the results of the consultations. The European Union and Ukraine have a similar position on the issue of a contract with Russia. At the meeting, EU representatives proposed clear requirements on the procedure for signing a business agreement with the prescribed deadlines. The Ukrainian side is ready to sign a new contract on 17 December.
But despite the expiring contract, Gazprom has not yet submitted a single official written proposal to Ukraine to resolve the situation, Naftogaz reported. Moreover, it is the Russian side that appears to be resorting to “gas blackmail”. The Kremlin requires Ukraine to abandon the Stockholm arbitration decision, according to which a Russian company owes Naftogaz almost $ 2.6 billion for neglecting the terms of a previous contract for the transit of resources through the Ukrainian gas transportation system. Ukraine cannot agree to these conditions.
Gas disputes between Russia and Ukraine are one of Russia's favourite fields for spreading fakes. Read similar cases in which it is stated that Ukraine plans to disrupt gas transit to the EU and that Kyiv will not sign a new contract.

In Ukraine, double standards apply: the Ukrainian police can imprison a person for carrying the emblem of the USSR, but does not touch people who demonstrate Nazi symbols.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the Nazis in Ukraine. 
In Ukraine in 2015, the law on decommunisation, initiated by the Cabinet of Ministers, entered into force.

367,THE INCIDENT IN THE KERCH STRAIT WAS A CRIME OF THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY,"SUMMARY
Ukraine will get back its ships detained in Crimea, but only after recognising their provocation in the Kerch Strait. The Russian side considers the incident in the strait as a crime of the Ukrainian military.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the Kerch incident.
On the 25th of November 2018, border patrol boats belonging to Russia’s FSB security service seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat and their crews after shooting at them, wounding several Ukrainian servicemen and arresting 24 members.
Russia stated they were in Russian waters. However, according to the bilateral agreement between Ukraine and Russia, the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov are the internal waters of both Russia and Ukraine.
The agreement gives both parties the power to inspect suspicious vessels. Furthermore, both the 2003 bilateral agreement and UN Convention on the Law of the Sea provide for freedom of navigation.

368,SKRIPAL CASE AND MH17 ACCUSATIONS AGAINST RUSSIA HAVE NO EVIDENCE – IT IS RUSSOPHOBIA,"SUMMARY
Britain has blamed Russia for an alleged nerve poison attack on former intelligence officer Sergey Skripal in 2018, without any evidence. The situation with discrimination against Russian media was worrying and resembled the Skripal case, in which nobody had explained anything. This is about Russophobia, the desire to justify one’s own failures and the unfair competition that goes with it.
The same applies to the Boeing of Malaysia Airlines. Dutch prosecutors say that an investigation is underway, while reparations have already been demanded from Russia. If Russia asks where the data from Ukrainian radars are, where the airlines’ communications data are, where the American satellite images are, it gets no answers. However, Russia still gets the blame.
DISPROOF
No evidence provided. Russophobia is often used in pro-Kremlin disinformation as an explanation for the West blaming Russia for anything. This message also contains recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury and about the downing of the flight MH17.
In fact, there is no discrimination against Russia or Russophobia. Western media represent a wide range of opinions and do not follow a single editorial policy on any given topic.
British police and intelligence investigations have produced sufficient hard evidence to charge two Russian nationals for the attack on the Skripals. More British public documents and statements on the case can be found here. The investigative outlet Bellingcat has later revealed the true identities of the two Russian nationals.
Concerning the downing of flight MH17, on 28 September 2016, the Joint Investigation Team announced that flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from the 9M38 series, which was launched by a BUK TELAR missile system. The system was transported from the Russian Federation to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in Eastern Ukraine, from there the missile was launched. After firing, the system, with 1 missing missile, went back to the Russian Federation. On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation.

377,Interview Vladimir Tzemach for Wyszynski: not a word about Boeing,"Ex-editor of ""RIA Novosti Ukraine"" Cyril Wyszynski interviewed one of the defendants in the case of the collapse of the Malaysian Boeing Vladimir Tzemach. In the summer of 2019 Ukrainian special services have detained Tzemach on the territory of the self-proclaimed ""DNI"", later it was included in the list of exchange of prisoners between Ukraine and Russia. StopFake checked for the presence of fakes interview. Most interestingly, the MH17 tragedy and Tzemach role in it during the interview did not uspominalis. The so-called ""antiaircrafter DNI"" Vladimir Tzemach considered possibly involved in the crash MH17 airliner. He was commander of the ""Air Defense Battalion / h 08801"" to June 27, 2019 in the snow.
Half of the interview, which also gave the Tzemach former prisoner in the Ukraine, and now the executive director in the media holding ""Russia Today"" Kirill Vyshinsky was focused on how the Tzemach was in Ukraine as a result of the special operation of special services. At the same time Vladimir Tzemach said that during the operation a few SBU allegedly blown up by mine own. In fact, during a special operation really killed one scout APU and one was wounded. The scouts went through a site that controlled the so-called 100 Brigade ""Guard"", ""DNR"", and were exposed to anti-personnel mines prohibited by the Geneva Convention.
Tzemach also talks about the conditions under which he was detained as he took the testimony in Ukraine, as talk to him representatives of the Netherlands. At the same time, the Russian site ""News"" in the title writes that he was allegedly ""beat, cut away, bribed,"" although the Tzemach said that when he was asked about any threats, he replied: ""If life in prison - is not a threat, the everything is fine, everything is good. "" But he called the actions in relation to themselves ""the state terrorism"" in general, and himself - ""victim of terrorism"".
Vladimir Tzemach said that Ukraine has nothing on it can not be, ""because he did not participate in these events."" It is worth noting that throughout the interview Vladimir Tzemach and Cyril Wyszynski did not discuss the investigation into the MH17 tragedy itself, why Tzemach was an important witness, and why it was important for it to be listed on an exchange in Russia.

378,Fake: Kiev refused to remove its mines in the Donbas is to make Finland,"Russian propaganda channel ""Constantinople"" published untrue news that Ukraine allegedly refuses Donbass mine clearance, so for her, it will make Finland.

388,GREEK CHURCH IS GOING TO INCORPORATE THE CHURCH OF TSKHINVALI,"SUMMARY
First, Greece recognised Ukraine’s [church] and now Greece has started talks about Tskhinvali, as if it is an independent diocese and has to be subordinated under the Greek church.
DISPROOF
The claim that the Greek church is going to recognize Tskhinvali church [in a breakaway Georgian territory] as an independent eparchy is a conspiracy theory and has no proof.
The disinformation narrative was disseminated after the recognition of the Ukrainian church, alleging that Constantinople would recognize the independence of the churches of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
In fact, Patriarchate of Constantinople recognizes the boundaries of the Georgian Church in accordance with the territory of the Republic of Georgia as of 1990, which includes Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions, too. The Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I, publicly supported the given borders in 2017.",REAL
389,MINSK AGREEMENTS CONFIRM THERE IS A CIVIL WAR IN UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
The Minsk agreements, which is truly the only document recognised by the entire international community, because it is endorsed at the level of the UN Security Council, says that this is an internal conflict in Ukraine. There is never a single word about Russia, only in the context that it is the guarantor of the implementation of the Minsk agreements.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that targets the Minsk agreements and justifies Russia's involvement in the war in Ukraine.
The Minsk agreements (the 2014 memorandum and 2015 plan of action) is the roadmap to the stabilisation of the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. It is true that both documents do not mention Russia as a side involved in the war, however, the documents do not mention the sides whatsoever. There is no clause in the Minsk agreements that defines the conflict as ""internal"". On the contrary, the Minsk agreements (paragraph 10) state clearly the need to withdraw “all foreign armed formations, military equipment, as well as mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine under the monitoring of the OSCE.”
Previous investigations prove Russia's involvement in the war in East Ukraine. International observers have collected evidence confirming the participation of Russia’s armed forces in the battles in Donbas, the supply of weapons as well as other support to the mercenaries.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that “the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation"". This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue to flow into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"". At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014, and at successive summits since then, allied leaders also demanded that Russia refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.",REAL
390,RUSSIA PREVENTED GENOCIDE IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
Russia is not an aggressor, but in fact, it was the only force that was able to stop the genocide of the population of [Donbas].
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine and the claimed genocide of ethnic Russians in Ukraine.
Human rights missions that travelled to Ukraine in 2014 did not find evidence that the Russian minority would have been in danger. See, for instance, the Advisory Committee’s Ad hoc report on the situation of national minorities in Ukraine, adopted on 1 April 2014 by the Council of Europe; June 2014 report on the human rights situation in Ukraine by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and statement by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities on her Visit to Ukraine published on 4 April 2014.
The claim also disregards the extensive factual evidence confirming the ongoing Russian military presence in Donbas.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that “the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation"". This international armed conflict began, at the latest, on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.

391,A RUTHLESS US DOESN’T ALLOW ARGENTINA TO PUT AN END TO HUNGER,"SUMMARY
The US responded to the newly elected president of Argentina with a threat. Alberto Fernández’s plan ‘Argentina without hunger’, which includes the renegotiation of the debt with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a strategy, found a ruthless answer from the US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin.
DISPROOF
This is a deliberate misinterpretation of Steven Mnuchin's statements, whose exact words were that Argentina had a commitment to the IMF and the US expected the new government to uphold it. However, he didn’t close the door to a renegotiation, only pointing out that if Argentina wanted this, they have to present a plan to the IMF for review, as with any other country. Besides, by directly linking Mnuchin’s alleged inflexibility to the hunger reduction programmes, this narrative tries to present the US as responsible for the suffering of the Argentinian people, in line with recurrent Russian disinformation about an evil US to be blamed for many of the world's problems, such as missile proliferation, Europe's disintegration, the promotion of coups and destabilisation all over the world (from Bolivia to Hong Kong, Russia, Syria, Venezuela or Hungary), the downing of Malaysian airlines flights, the sponsorship of religious destabilising movements and terrorism, the ignition of wars and the corruption of human rights.",REAL

The IMF has nothing at all to do with humanity, nothing at all. On the contrary, the IMF is practically a war instrument of the great power; the USA. That is quite clear, it is a financial war instrument used to exploit countries.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory with no evidence. Consistent with pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the IMF.
The IMF is an international organisation with 189 members, including the US and Russia. The decision making at the IMF is designed to reflect the relative positions of its member countries in the global economy. The IMF continues to undertake reforms to ensure that its governance structure adequately reflects fundamental changes taking place in the world economy.
The IMF is working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.
Created in 1945, the IMF is governed by and accountable to the 189 countries that make up its near-global membership.",REAL
393,UKRAINE IS RULED BY US AND NATO,"SUMMARY
Now the Americans command what Ukraine should do, but Ukraine does not want to understand this. Its Avakov [minister of internal affairs of Ukraine] goes there for instructions, and everyone else. Zelenskyy waits to shake the hand, but the NATO Secretary-General does not even notice him. He came to Kyiv as a boss, said everything needed, and Zelenskyy had to ask for permission to speak.
DISPROOF
Recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative, challenging Ukrainian statehood. For example, pro-Kremlin media has claimed that Ukraine has become a vassal of Germany and Ukraine is under US control.
Ukraine is a sovereign state. Neither the US nor NATO controls Ukraine. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by most of the free world but were violated by Russia in 2014.
The relations between the US and Ukraine are bilateral relations between two independent countries. The US recognised Ukraine as an independent state on 25 December 1991. US policy is centred on realising and strengthening a stable, democratic, prosperous, and free Ukraine, more closely integrated into Europe and Euro-Atlantic structures.
Ukraine is one of the strategic partners of NATO. The Alliance respects Ukrainian sovereignty and independence and works closely with the Ukrainian authorities in particular in the framework of NATO-Ukraine commission, Joint working group on defence reform, and other ongoing programs. In late October 2019, the meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission was held in Kyiv. The parties discussed the security situation in and around Ukraine, the reform process within the country, as well as progress in the NATO-Ukraine partnership. NATO Secretary-General underlined NATO's continuing support to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.",REAL

Dutch and Australian investigators participated in fabrication of the MH17 case, which is a crime. They also tried to bribe Volodymyr Tsemakh, by offering witness protection, citizenship and a house in Holland.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Joint International Investigation and the downing of the flight MH17. 
A special team, known as the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.  On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT  the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute 4 individuals for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering of 289 persons on board.
The JIT has also launched an appeal for witnesses who might have more information about the persons involved in the downing of the MH17. Every witness who comes forward maybe offered a witness safety and protection program. If necessary the program can protect witness identities and may include the use of assumed identities and may include re-location and in some cases permanent re-settling in another country.

404,"IN CASE OF RATIFICATION OF ISTANBUL CONVENTION AN INFLUX OF 50,000 PERVERTS FROM ABROAD IS EXPECTED","SUMMARY
Over fifty thousand signatures have already been collected in Armenia against ratification of the Istanbul Convention.
Istanbul Convention provides broad rights to transvestites, homosexuals, lesbians and other perverts in Armenia. Under Article 60, by ratifying the Convention, the country is obliged to grant asylum to persons who were persecuted on the basis of sexual orientation. In the case of ratification of the Istanbul Convention, a flow of perverts is expected.
There is internal information that the initial number for the Republic of Armenia is 50,000. Therefore, after ratifying the document we are obliged to provide asylum to 50,000 people.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on Istanbul Convention.
The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence is based on the understanding that violence against women is a form of gender-based violence that is committed against women because they are women. It is the obligation of the state to fully address it in all its forms and to take measures to prevent violence against women, protect its victims and prosecute the perpetrators.
The Convention opponents are manipulating with misinterpretation of definitions, presenting the gender-based violence as persecution on a basis of sexual orientation. Article 60 of the Convention is about gender-based asylum claims. According to Article 60 ""Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that gender-based violence against women may be recognised as a form of persecution within the meaning of Article 1, A (2), of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and as a form of serious harm giving rise to complementary/subsidiary protection.""

Where were you born? In Kyiv. Therefore, the war is civilian. Once again, this is a civil war. The person who was born in Kyiv is the Deputy Minister of information of the DNR.
In 2014, an unconstitutional coup d’etat took place. Most of the population of Ukraine, citizens of Ukraine, several million people did not recognise the results of this unconstitutional coup and seizure of power by the junta led by Turchinov. And they revolted. After that, a civil war broke out. As a result of the war, the two republics proclaimed themselves independent, namely the DNR and LNR.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Euromaidan and war in Ukraine. It disregards the extensive factual evidence confirming ongoing Russian military presence in Donbas. There have been many investigations proving Russia's involvement in the war in east Ukraine.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim.
The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict, but an act of aggression by the Russian armed forces, that continue since February 2014.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that “the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation"". This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"". At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014 and at successive summits since then, allied leaders also demanded that Russia refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.",REAL
406,"CATALAN PROTESTS ARE STAGED BY THE US AND SOROS TO PUNISH SPAIN FOR ITS RELATIONS WITH CUBA
","SUMMARY
A Catalan “hotspot” in economically developed Spain, in a country with no big ethnic differences between the regions, came as a surprise to many. Hence, the source of this madness is located outside the country. Among other things, George Soros’ organisations provided support for Catalan unrest. The US is not happy that Madrid has been developing relations with Cuba lately. A quarter of all foreign companies registered in Cuba are Spanish. In terms of imports, in 2017, Spain was Cuban’s second largest trading partner. Spain also invests a lot and is gradually taking control of the Cuban touristic industry. Hence, Madrid assists Havana at a time when the world’s hegemon attempts to choke Cuba with sanctions. Some people in the US must have taken Spanish activities in Cuba as an aspiration to revive the Spanish colonial empire in a new form. Americans repeatedly warned Spaniards about possible consequences for playing with Cuba, but Madrid did not take the threats seriously.
DISPROOF
This is conspiracy theory, one of many about George Soros, and consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about US' destabilising actions elsewhere to favour its policies.
The recent strike and protests in Catalonia erupted because of the ruling of Spain’s Supreme Court which sentenced nine Catalan pro-independence leaders to jail for sedition. Although Donald Trump's administration is more confrontational with Cuba than his predecessor's office, there is no proof that the US is behind the Catalan protests in retaliation for Spanish-Cuban economic cooperation.

407,"RUSSIA ON MH17: UNTIL TODAY, NO EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED – ONLY EMPTY CLAIMS","SUMMARY
Allegations towards Russia in the downing of flight MH17 are groundless. Even to this day, no evidence has been provided – only empty claims.
Dutch prosecutors say that an investigation is underway, while Russia has already been asked for compensation. If we ask where the data from Ukrainian radars are, where the airlines’ communications data are, where the American satellite images are, we get no answers. However, Russia still gets the blame.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the downing of flight MH17. Actually, the JIT has provided concrete evidence of Russia's involvement.
On the 28th of September 2016, the JIT announced that flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from the 9M38 series, which was launched by a BUK TELAR missile system. The system was transported from the Russian Federation to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in Eastern Ukraine, where the missile was launched. After firing, the system - with 1 missing missile – was transported back to the Russian Federation. On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced its conclusion that the BUK TELAR used to shoot down MH17 came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation.
On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, with the participation of law enforcement agencies from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, Ukraine and the Netherlands, the Dutch Public Persecution service will prosecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the MH17 crash and murdering all 298 persons on board. The Public Prosecution Service alleges that the four individuals cooperated to obtain and deploy the BUK TELAR at the firing location with the aim of shooting down an aircraft. For that reason, they can also be held jointly accountable for downing flight MH17.
The JIT conclusions were further corroborated by the Bellingcat Investigation Team. For the full Bellingcat report see here.",REAL
408,UKRAINE IS GOVERNED FROM OUTSIDE AND DOESN’T INTEREST ANYBODY,"SUMMARY
Ukraine does not interest Abromavicius [the general director of the state company Ukroboronprom], it does not interest the people who rule our country from the outside, because they only care about their own interests.
DISPROOF
No evidence given. Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about Ukraine, which they claim is under the external control of the US or EU. It also implies that Ukraine has been abandoned.
Ukraine is a sovereign state, not controlled by any foreign government or international organisation. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world, including the EU.
The pro-Kremlin media have produced other disinformation claims where they insist Ukraine is under foreign control.

The Americans need Ukraine only to weaken Russia and the EU. Because the EU is a competitor. The Americans need [Ukraine] in this particular moment with their internal problem over the impeachment of Trump. In this regard, Ukraine is interesting for Trump. Therefore, the Americans want to hand this problem over to Russia and the EU and the more they struggle with it, the better for the US.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. Apart from being ungrounded, this message also repeats disinformation narratives about the EU and US relations with Ukraine.
Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The EU and the US support the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter’s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence.
The relations between the US and Ukraine are bilateral relations between two independent countries. The USA recognised Ukraine as an independent state on 25th December 1991. The US policy is centred on realising and strengthening a stable, democratic, prosperous and free Ukraine, more closely integrated into Europe and Euro-Atlantic structures.",REAL
410,"IN THE WEST, WHITE MALE HETEROSEXUALS ARE INCREASINGLY TREATED AS CRIMINALS BY COURTS","SUMMARY
In the Western world white male heterosexuals are branded as “exploiters” of everyone else: females, coloured people, homosexuals, new transgender species, Jews. White male heterosexuals cannot defend themselves against discrimination and are increasingly treated as criminals by courts. In the West, it is very difficult for a white male heterosexual to get a position in a university. In the UK and in European countries, university employment openings are restricted to women and coloured people.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the threats to traditional values in the West, which is used to discredit liberal Western attitudes about a variety of normative issues, including the rights of women and of ethnic and religious minorities. This narrative is one of the most frequently used by pro-Kremlin outlets.
No evidence is provided to support the article’s claims. It is not true that in Western societies white heterosexual males are “discriminated against”,“treated as criminals”, and excluded from university teaching positions.
The EU is committed to safeguarding fundamental rights. It has adopted measures to combat racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance that target people because of their race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation or gender identity, disability, social status or other characteristics. The EU also promotes gender equality as a fundamental human right.

Russian state efforts to affect the outcome of the Brexit vote are well-documented in news reports, and parliamentary enquiries (see especially pp. 43-52).
In the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the Kremlin continues to officially maintain that the Russian state has never been implicated in cyber crimes. See our debunk of this claim here.

412,THE WESTERN WORLD IS DOMINATED BY A HANDFUL OF PERVERTS AND IS BASED ON THE LIES OF WOKE IDEOLOGIES,"SUMMARY
The Western world is based on lies, the lies of Woke ideologies and a handful of perverts dominate Western populations.  According to Woke ideologies, there is no difference between men and women, there are many genders, and men and women can be born into the wrong bodies. The objective truth is unacceptable in today’s Woke-dominated West because it “offends” the self-declared “victims” of white heterosexual males, such as feminists, the new transgender species and others.
Anybody, especially white heterosexual males, who attempts to speak the truth loses their job. Those white heterosexual men that work in the Western media and wish to keep their job must tell lies and demonise Russia, Trump and white heterosexual males themselves.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. No evidence provided.
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative portraying the West as decadent and hostile to traditional values and Europe as ruled  by homosexuals and lesbians who are imposing their perverted values on the rest of society. The narrative about “threatened values” is adapted to a wide range of topics and typically used to discredit liberal Western attitudes about the rights of women, ethnic and religious minorities and LGBTI groups, among others. According to this narrative, the “effeminate West” is rotting under the onslaught of decadence, feminism, homosexuality and “political correctness”, while Russia defends traditional family values.
It is not true that the West is ruled by “perverts” who have imposed their own values and ideologies on society. One of the major achievements of the liberal-democratic West, and of Europe in particular, is the institutionalisation of tolerance and pluralism, which means the peaceful coexistence of different religions, world-views and value-systems within the same society.
The EU strongly supports the position that all individuals, without discrimination, are entitled to enjoy the full range of human rights. LGBT people have the same human rights as everyone else, including the right to non-discrimination. They constitute a vulnerable group and remain victims of persecution, discrimination and gross ill-treatment, often involving extreme forms of violence.

413,WHITE HELMETS AND TERRORISTS ARE PREPARING A NEW FRONT AGAINST RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
White Helmets and terrorists are preparing chemical weapons and a new front against Russia. They also continue to stage videos about attacks in Syria.
White Helmets’ videos present too many coincidences to be real.
DISPROOF
No evidence given. Recurring pro-Kremlin conspiracy theory painting the White Helmets as terrorists.
The White Helmets are a staple topic of pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on the Syrian civil war, having already been accused of numerous other provocations and war crimes including organ trafficking; aiding terrorist organizations; staging and/or
perpetrating chemical attacks, sometimes with the help of Western intelligence agencies. A majority of these claims are unburdened by evidence and often rely on meaningless formulations such as ""according to information provided by X,"" ""there are reasons to assume,"" and so forth.
See here on the importance of White Helmets in Russian and Syrian disinformation.
The White Helmets, also known as Syria Civil Defence, are a Syrian volunteer organisation dedicated to saving, protecting and helping civilians during the Syrian conflict. In 2018 some 800 White Helmets and their families were rescued from Syria as they were at imminent risk following the escalation of violence in south west Syria.",REAL

Western Media artificially distorted the history of World War II. Biased publications in the Western media were aimed at distorting the essence of World War II. Even more, belittling Russia’s importance in achieving victory over fascism.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about WWII. No evidence of Western media manipulating WWII coverage.
The European Parliament called the war as the bloodiest tragedy of the century, which resulted in millions of victims of authoritarian regimes of fascist Germany and the USSR. The European Parliament has also expressed concern about the efforts of the current Russian leadership to whitewash the crimes committed by the Soviet totalitarian regime and see them as a dangerous component of the information war against democratic Europe.

415,TRUMP’S POLICY TOWARDS POLAND IS SUPPOSED TO SATISFY THE AMERICAN “DEEP STATE”,"SUMMARY
Donald Trump has to shape his policies taking into consideration the position of various domestic power groups, which disfavour him. If Trump was free of their influence, the current international situation would look completely different. Without his own strong political camp, in some situations, Trump is forced to “give a smile” to the so-called “deep state”, which forms the core of American politics. Trump’s policy towards Poland is one of the elements, which is supposed to satisfy the “deep state”.
DISPROOF
This message presents a classical conspiracy theory that the “deep state” and “shadow government” control the work of democratic institutions in the United States. Here are some other examples of this narrative: “Deep state” fighting with Trump; FBI appears under the influence of “Deep state”; “Deep state” shaping NATO policies. No reputable political scientists and researchers confirm the existence of a “deep state” in the United States.
The idea of a ""deep state"" has always been very popular among conspiracy theorists. Its manifestations might be different, but generally the concept conjures up the image of a small group deciding the fate of the world behind the scenes. However, there is no evidence of such a ""permanent bureaucracy"" or ""permanent government"" existing in the United States.",REAL
416,NATO LIES ABOUT THE REASONS FOR THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL,"SUMMARY
NATO lies about the reasons for the fall of the Berlin Wall. The West did not play any role in the unification of East and West Germany 30 years ago. There was no desire for freedom and no revolutions in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative involving historical revisionism and denials that the Soviet regime was totalitarian.
After the speech of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Pro-Kremlin media were outraged by Stoltenberg’s phrase that it was democracy and freedom of thought that helped reunite Europe. At the Berlin Wall Memorial at NATO Headquarters, Stoltenberg emphasised that even then, Europeans were united by basic values: ""freedom, democracy and human dignity."" Thanks to these, ""peace and solidarity can prevail over any adversary."" It was freedom that was able to prevail over oppression. These shared values “allowed Europe to develop deep partnerships with friends around the world,” leading to the fall of dictatorship and the spread of democracy, Stoltenberg said.
Communist East German authorities built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to stop the flow of residents into the democratic, and free, West. For almost 30 years, the Berlin Wall separated West Berlin from the East German state, the GDR, which was in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. When trying to overcome it, hundreds of people were killed.
On 9 November 1989, against the backdrop of mass protests in the GDR, among others, the communist authorities announced that they would change the rules for crossing the border. On that same evening, thousands of people headed towards the Berlin Wall, demanding that they be allowed to enter the West. The fall of the Berlin Wall under the pressure of people has become a symbol of peaceful revolutions against the communist dictatorship in Europe.",REAL

418,GEORGIAN ARMED GROUPS ARE USING EUMM TO PROVOKE TSKHINVALI INTO INADEQUATE BEHAVIOUR,"SUMMARY
During these three months, Georgia demonstrated to South Ossetia and the entire international community the whole set of clichés and tactical steps with which, in theory, the armed confrontation begins. More precisely, setting up a system of posts along the state border, pulling together power units, seizing strategic (high) positions and firing at a quadcopter of the General Prosecutor’s Office of South Ossetia. In addition, shooting in the direction of the state border, attempting to infiltrate South Ossetian territory by armed groups and even using the EUMM as an element that can provoke Tskhinvali into inadequate behaviour.
DISPROOF
This is an organised disinformation campaign targeting the EU's Monitoring Mission (EUMM) in Georgia. See the EEAS statement which assesses the statements from South Ossetia about security actions and developments as ""factually incorrect"". It further states:
""The attempts from within South Ossetia, both in action and through statements, to prevent the Mission’s work and restrict its mandate are deplorable and must stop.""
In addition, the EUMM has not confirmed any shots from the Georgian side.
The EUMM was deployed immediately following the war between Russia and Georgia in 2008. Its mandate is to support the restoration of ordinary life, to prevent a return to hostilities, to build confidence among the conflict parties and to inform about EU policy. The European Union remains fully committed to peaceful conflict resolution in Georgia and reiterates its firm support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders.

419,ESTONIA IS TOTALITARIAN COUNTRY,"SUMMARY
Not even in Arab states we have ran into such a totalitarian system as in Estonia.

DISPROOF
The repeated disinformation narrative that there is no freedom of speech in the Baltic countries and that censorship flourishes there.
Estonia is a country in which democratic institutions are strong and political and civil rights in Estonia are widely respected. In the 2019 Freedom House report, Estonia scored 94 points out of a possible 100. Russia, in terms of democracy, is near the bottom of the rating and scored 20 points out of 100.
Freedom of speech in Estonia is guaranteed by the Constitution, laws and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In the world ranking of ""Reporters Without Borders"", Estonia ranks 11th for freedom of speech out of 180 countries. At the same time, Russia is in 149th place.

421,RUSSIA WILL BE ACQUITTED IN THE CRASH OF MH17 FOR A BRIBE,"SUMMARY
Ukrainian media revealed a “conspiracy”: Europe will admit Russia’s innocence of the crash of the Boeing MH17  if Moscow pays Amsterdam a “compensation”.
Russia and the Netherlands allegedly are in secret negotiations to pay compensation for the crashed airliner without admitting guilt for the tragedy.
DISPROOF
No evidence given regarding possible secret talks and recognition of the alleged Russia's innocence in the MH17 crash. Recurring disinformation narrative on MH17 downing.
Earlier this year, the Dutch foreign minister announced that his country was in diplomatic discussions with Russia about whether Moscow bears legal responsibility in the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet over Ukraine.
The Dutch-led criminal investigation on the MH17 crash by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has provided concrete evidence of Russia's involvement. The JIT conclusions were further corroborated by Bellingcat.
The European Union and NATO have called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability.

422,TRUMP MADE A DEAL WITH THE QUEEN AND THE ROTHSCHILDS: END OF PAEDOPHILIA CASE IN EXCHANGE FOR SECOND PRESIDENTIAL TERM,"SUMMARY
Given that George Soros declared war against Donald Trump in 2016, an attempt to impeach the latter was apparently sanctioned by the Rothschilds. Although they do not threaten him directly, Trump’s actions are constrained. This also suits the agreements reached between the Queen of the United Kingdom and Trump during his visit to London in June. The White House ends the investigation into links between a paedophile lobby and the US Democrats in exchange for a green light for a second presidential term. This is why instead of coherently struggling against the Democrats, Trump is attacking Joe Biden. The latter, though very corrupt, is not linked to paedophilia, unlike the Clintons.
DISPROOF
This article puts forward a number of unfounded claims and conspiracies and contains recurring propaganda pro-Kremlin narratives about all-mighty secret elites and deep state.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Skripal case was invented to cover up paedophilia scandals in the UK, that all high-ranking politicians in the Baltic states are likely implicated in paedophilia, and that the Holocaust was instigated by the evil Rothschilds for creating their own nation state.

Emmanuel Macron’s recent interview to The Economist does not contain his personal beliefs but rather the views of the Rothschild’s oligarchic clan. The thing is Macron has Rothschild political origins, plus The Economist is a mouthpiece of the Rothschilds.
The authors of Emmanuel Macron’s recent interview to The Economist hope for Russia’s “balanced cooperation” with Europe. They want Vladimir Putin to stop counteracting NATO’s enlargement. Apparently, they want Russia to surrender in Donbas, Crimea, and elsewhere. Russia’s real interests are drifting away from Europe’s. Europe is Eurasia’s geopolitical appendix and a puppet of Washington, shadow circles of the Anglo-Saxons and the Vatican.
DISPROOF
This article is based on conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds' secret influence over international media and EU politicians, and about the EU being under control of the US, the so called Anglo-Saxon world, and the Vatican. It adheres to frequent propagandistic pro-Kremlin narratives about lost sovereignty and some kind of superior government led by powerful financial circles who control the world's political agenda.

The current world follows the principle “Russians are everywhere.” However, in reality, the Russians have a lot of things to do domestically given the large size of the country. Small Western countries do not have much to do, so they imagine things. They imagine Novichok, election meddling and even recruitment of the American president. If Donald Trump was the Kremlin’s agent, he would use a malicious virus to destroy the system to manage the US’s nuclear capability to make the US surrender within half an hour.

426,"THE WEST WANTS TO IMPOSE POLISH-LITHUANIAN IDENTITY ON BELARUSIANS, BUT RUSSIA WILL PREVENT IT","SUMMARY
Belarus has always been part of Russia and has never been a subject of the political world. However, Minsk has begun positioning the country as if it is a distinct small country. The West has noticed and given the approval of Lukashenka’s attempts to distance from Russia. The West strengthens Lukashenka in many ways and blessed him to have a conflict with Russia. The plan is to impose a new identity on Belarusians, a Catholic, Central-European, and Polish-Lithuanian identity.
However, Lukashenka will not succeed in building an autonomous Belarusian duchy with Polish-Lithuanian identity and succession of power. Lukashenka committed the gravest mistake by turning away from Russia and by believing in an alliance with fascist Ukraine and a bloc of Western countries. Russia will not turn away from the path of restoration of the territorial unity of the historical statehood, returning the territories of historic Russia. If Lukashenka attempts to blackmail both Russia and the West, the West will stage a coup in Belarus.
DISPROOF
This article promotes the Russian World view on Belarus as the territories of historic Russia and is built on a number of conspiracies and a false dilemma about the direction of Belarus's socio-political development. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Western attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations, Ukraine as a fascist country, and Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia, specifically Western activities to compromise Belarusian identity.
Nothing suggests that Belarusian authorities or the West are planning to promote Polish-Lithuanian identity in Belarus, that Alyaksandr Lukashenka made a foreign policy U-turn towards the West, that the West ""blessed"" Lukashenka for a conflict with Russia or is preparing a coup in Belarus as alleged.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Belarus faces either normal development under Russia or a forced Polonization and economic devastation, that the Eastern Partnership aims to erode Belarusian identity and promote the views of Polish gentry, that Belarus will turn into anti-Russia in case it does not deepen integration with Russia, and putting forward a ridiculous false dilemma, claiming that the only possible scenario for Belarus to prevent descent into Nazism through the politicisation of national clothes is to become a Russian western federal area.",REAL
427,POLAND’S EASTERN POLICY IS DICTATED BY THE USA AIMING TO WEAKEN RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Warsaw does not carry out any type of policy towards its Eastern neighbours as all of the Polish foreign actions have turned into an instrument used to weaken the Russian positions in the post-Soviet region. For example, the Polish policy towards Ukraine has only one priority – to keep this country in the orbit of the anti-Russian states. Poland’s Eastern policy is formed by the actions dictated by the interests of the United States.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that the United States fully controls the foreign policy of Poland. See other examples of this message claiming that Polish policy towards Ukraine is shaped by the Americans, the US keeps Poland on a short anti-Russian leash, and Poland is a Trojan Horse of the United States.
The statement that the United States controls the European and Polish elites is a conspiracy theory. Poland is a sovereign state, which shapes its own foreign and domestic policies.
Poland carries out active foreign policy towards its Eastern neighbours – the Polish government underlines the importance of implementation of the pro-active Eastern policy. This policy is based on the promotion of key Polish interests in this region – strengthening of independence and security of the Polish Eastern neighbours, support for pro-European and transatlantic trends in the region and support for reforms in the countries of the post-Soviet region. Regarding Ukraine, the Polish government has repeatedly shown its full support to solving the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the complete restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine.

428,RIA FAN REVEALED WEST’S PLAN FOR THE COLLAPSE OF RUSSIA BY 2030,"SUMMARY
West does not want a strong and independent Russia. It has planned the collapse of Russia by splitting the society and dividing its regions by 2030, reveals a RIA FAN study. This will be similar to how the USSR was destroyed.
West is destabilizing Russia from the inside, artificially creating the reputation of an “aggressor”. It tries to convince Russians that their authorities are an enemy and uses the so-called opposition to promote pro-Western narratives in exchange for money.
The main goal of the West is the complete federalization of Russia with a final step of annexing the regions to other countries. North Ossetia will reunite with South and form a new state – Alania. China will annex some Russian eastern territories. Kamchatka, Chukotka will be occupied by the US, and Magadan Region, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to Japan. Kaliningrad region and Crimea will fall under the control of the European Union. The descendants of the Nazis who fled in 1945 will return to Kaliningrad, which will be renamed Koenigsberg. The Murmansk region will go to Norway, and Karelia will be given to Finland.

No evidence given. This is a recurring pro-Kremin conspiracy theory about West's alleged plans against Russia and alleged involvement of the West in the USSR's collapse.

China will annex some Russian eastern territories. Kamchatka, Chukotka will be occupied by the US, and Magadan Region, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to Japan. Kaliningrad region and Crimea will fall under the control of the European Union. The descendants of the Nazis who fled in 1945 will return to Kaliningrad, which will be renamed Koenigsberg.

434,THE MINISTER OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF UKRAINE SAID THAT IT WOULD NOT END THE WAR IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, bluntly stated that Ukraine will continue the war and that it does not need peace in Donbas. This happened during the visit of the delegation to the disengagement line on Donbas in the villages Petrivske and Zolotye.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that Ukraine is sabotaging peace in Donbas and that Ukraine does not need Donbas.
US Chargé d'Affaires to Ukraine, William Taylor, and the ambassadors of Great Britain, Germany and France together with the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Arsen Avakov, visited the scene of the withdrawal of front-line troops in Donbas on 7 November 2019. Diplomats recognised that Ukraine is abiding by the ceasefire and is fulfilling its part of the agreements.
When communicating with local residents, Avakov actually expressed hope that the withdrawing of the front-line troops would happen in the whole region, up until the border with Russia. “I hope that peace will be final throughout the country. I hope that the next time troops will be withdrawing, Donetsk will be liberated to us,” the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine emphasised.",REAL

The events in Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014) were anti-Russian provocations fully backed by the West. The anti-Russian course which these countries assumed is part of the West’s Russophobic geopolitical strategy in place since 1991.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative claiming that the 2008 Russo-Georgian War and the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests in Kyiv were backed and/or carried out by the West, and primarily designed to provoke/weaken/destabilise Russia.
The five-day Russo-Georgian conflict resulted in the Russian military presence in both Abkhazia and South Ossetia that is in violation of Georgian and international law. The claim that the conflict was a Western-backed provocation is unsupported by evidence.
In recent weeks, a disinformation campaign has been attempting to discredit the EU Monitoring mission in Georgia, see statement here. See here also for an EEAS statement on recent developments related to South Ossetia, Georgia and calling on all relevant actors to show maximum restraint and refrain from any steps or statement that could escalate the situation.
As for Ukraine, the spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.

438,PRESENTING UKRAINE AS A SOVEREIGN NATION IS A COMPLETE LIE,"SUMMARY
Ukraine is now almost completely under Washington’s control thanks to the US meddling that was the cause for the Maidan and the war in Donbas. The “powers that be” in Kiev push a hardcore anti-Russian/pro-EU/pro-Western agenda, because they have to serve masters who got them into power. Presenting Ukraine as a sovereign nation that needs to be won over to America’s side is a complete lie.
DISPROOF
Recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative, challenging Ukrainian statehood. For example, pro-Kremlin media has claimed that Ukraine has become a vassal of Germany and Ukraine is under US control.
Ukraine is a sovereign state. Neither the US nor NATO controls Ukraine. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by most of the free world but were violated by Russia in 2014.
The relations between the US and Ukraine are bilateral relations between two independent countries. The US recognised Ukraine as an independent state on 25 December 1991. US policy is centred on realising and strengthening a stable, democratic, prosperous, and free Ukraine, more closely integrated into Europe and Euro-Atlantic structures.
Ukraine is one of the strategic partners of NATO.

And in the The German Democratic Republic they also say that kindergartens worked differently. And the early education programme, when in kindergarten, children began to march to sounds from the piano. This actually helps a child to develop. And in modern Germany, there’s no money for that. Why? And that’s where the political slot begins. Because the money goes to migrants.

Money for kindergartens in Germany has not been reduced in favour of migrants.

442,"IN UKRAINE, PENSIONERS FREEZE WITHOUT RUSSIAN GAS","SUMMARY
The Ukrainian authorities say that they do not need Russian gas. But in reality, Ukrainian pensioners freeze, because they were left without heating on the eve of winter.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative claiming that Ukraine will not survive without Russian gas and that it is necessary to conclude a contract with Gazprom.
By the beginning of winter 2019, the underground storage facilities of Ukrtransgaz (the service company which belongs to Naftogaz of Ukraine) had accumulated 20 billion cubic metres of gas. This indicator is the highest Ukrainian gas reserves for nine years.

443,THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION IS A THREAT TO THE ARMENIAN ARMY,"SUMMARY
One of the most important institutions to preserve the Armenian people is our traditional Christian family. The ratification of the Istanbul Convention with many contradictory and dangerous provisions is a danger. It will disrupt the family-Christian values of the Armenian people. As a result, it is a threat to the Armenian Army’s combat readiness and national spirit. The convention is contradicting the current Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, to the centuries-old Christian and moral values of the Armenian people.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on the Istanbul Convention. This message is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the morally corrupt West and threatened traditional values.
The Istanbul Convention (the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence) is a treaty of the Council of Europe that opens the path for creating a legal framework at pan-European level to protect women against all forms of violence, and prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence.
The Armenian Ministry of Justice clarifies that the Convention does not threaten Armenia's traditional values. The Convention states that traditions, cultures and religion cannot justify violence against women. In addition, the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe issued an opinion that ""there are no provisions in that Convention that could be said to “contradict” the Constitution of Armenia"".

445,UKRAINE HAS NO DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR DONBAS,"SUMMARY
There is no development strategy for Donbas in Ukraine except to take billions from Russia. In Ukraine, even next year’s budget does not include funds for the Donbas. They are not going to reintegrate with anyone.
DISPROOF
A recurring disinformation narrative that it's impossible to reconnect Donbas with Ukraine, and there is no willingness to do it.
On the contrary, the Donbas reintegration strategy is being developed at the state level. Between 2015-2019 it was the State Agency of Ukraine on the rehabilitation of the Donbas. The new government in Ukraine is planning to develop the Donbas reintegration plan by 2020.
On 30 October 2019, in Mariupol, the Donetsk region, there was a ""Unity Forum"" with the President of Ukraine, government and NGOs. The main theme is the return of Donbas. The purpose of the forum is to establish a dialogue between the public and the authorities in order to overcome the challenges arising from the conflict in Donbas and its consequences. As a result of the event, participants plan to develop a roadmap for change to implement the strategy in the areas prescribed.
At the same time, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine includes the reintegration of the occupied territories of Donbas to the state budget and the macroeconomic forecast as well.

446,THERE IS A CIVIL WAR IN DONBAS AFTER THE REGION REBELLED AGAINST THE ILLEGAL GOVERNMENT IN KYIV,"SUMMARY
The civil war in Ukraine began in April 2014 after a coup which happened in the country. Donetsk and Luhansk did not want to obey the government that illegally came to power and declared independence. In response, Kyiv launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation against the republics of Donbas.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Euromaidan and war in Ukraine. It disregards the extensive factual evidence confirming ongoing Russian military presence in Donbas. There have been many investigations proving Russia's involvement in the war in east Ukraine.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim.
The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict, but an act of aggression by the Russian armed forces, that continues since February 2014. The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"". At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014 and at successive summits since then, allied leaders also demanded that Russia refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
According to the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Russian special forces and troops operated to mobilise, lead, equip, and support separatist militias in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine from spring 2014 to the present, although their presence was denied by Moscow.

447,EVIDENCE SHOWS CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN SYRIA WERE FALSIFIED BY THE WHITE HELMETS,"SUMMARY
In India, a Russian expert presented evidence of the falsification of the chemical attacks in Syria.
It is noted that the representatives of India paid due attention to information about the involvement of the White Helmets in the staging [of the chemical attacks]. They operate in the territories not controlled by Damascus.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring and enduring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the White Helmets.
The ""White Helmets"" movement originated in Syria in 2012, when the first detachments of volunteer rescuers appeared in the territories outside the control of Bashar al-Assad's troops. In 2014, volunteer teams merged into a national organisation, the Syrian Civil Defence, which is the official name of the 'White Helmets'.  Volunteers save people from the rubble after bombings, despite the danger to themselves as a result of repeated air strikes.  Activists from this organisation have documented the use of chemical weapons in Syria by the Assad government and allied forces. Because of this, they have become the target of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign.

448,THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN AGGRESSION IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
Official Kyiv demanded reparations from Russia for a destroyed economy, destroyed infrastructure of Donbas. They destroyed it, and Russia must pay reparations. In fact, Ukraine did not formally declare war on Russia. And certainly, it did not win. And no Russian aggression, even from a formal point of view, has been recorded either in the Minsk agreements or in the OSCE reports.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, claiming that Russia is not part of the conflict in Donbas, that Russia has nothing to do with the war in eastern Ukraine and that there is a “civil war” in Donbas.
There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The EU condemns the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"".  At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014, NATO leaders condemned in the strongest terms Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine and demanded Russia to stop and withdraw its forces from Ukraine and from the country’s border. NATO leaders also demanded Russia complies with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine.
Forensic Architecture, a London-based research group, has collected and catalogued evidence of Russian military involvement in the battle of Ilovaysk in August 2014, including the presence of a model of tank used only by the Russian armed forces at that time.",REAL
449,THE US DECIDED TO CHANGE GLOBAL SECURITY SYSTEM BY BLAMING COLLAPSE OF THE INF TREATY ON RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
The United States decided to reformat the global security system in their favour. What is important here is the US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (the INF Treaty). This decision was first mentioned by President Trump in October 2018. What is absolutely not surprising is that they had found “weighty” arguments to justify this decision. Allegedly, back in 2008, Russia developed a missile that can cover a distance of over 500 km. Moscow’s arguments that the “suspicious” missile 9M729 has a much smaller flight range have been simply ignored by Washington.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the INF Treaty.
Russia bears primary responsibility for the end of the INF Treaty because it has produced, tested and deployed the 9M729 missile, which violates the agreement. In July 2014, the then-US President Obama officially accused Russia of testing a missile in violation of the INF Treaty, which prohibits the US or Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of between 500 and 5500 kilometres.
In a joint statement released after the meeting held at NATO Headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday 4 and Wednesday 5 December 2018, NATO Foreign Ministers stated that the United States has remained in full compliance with its obligations under the INF Treaty since it entered into force and that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security.""
US and NATO have repeatedly engaged with Russia to preserve the INF treaty. For background on pro-Kremlin myths on the INF Treaty see here.
The recent ""Statement by the North Atlantic Council on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty"" noted that ""Russia today remains in violation of the INF Treaty, despite years of U.S. and Allied engagement, including a final opportunity over six months to honour its treaty obligations. Russia bears sole responsibility for the demise of the Treaty.""",REAL
450,HOLODOMOR WAS LARGE-SCALE SABOTAGE AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION,"SUMMARY
The biggest sabotage is the story of the Holodomor. The famine is called the Holodomor, and some people continue to replicate this name. The Holodomor means that the people were starved deliberately. Not a single document has been found to prove that people were starved deliberately. It was large-scale sabotage against Ukrainians in the Soviet Union invented in Canada, in the USA, and in Western Ukraine.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring Kremlin narrative about the Holodomor in Ukraine.
The Great Famine (Holodomor) of 1932–33 is a man-made demographic catastrophe unprecedented in peacetime. Of the estimated six to eight million people who died in the Soviet Union, about four to five million were Ukrainians. The exact number of victims is hard to establish as a lot of evidence was destroyed.
According to Encyclopaedia Britannica,"" the famine was a direct assault on the Ukrainian peasantry, which had stubbornly continued to resist collectivisation; indirectly, it was an attack on the Ukrainian village, which traditionally had been a key element of Ukrainian national culture. Its deliberate nature is underscored by the fact that no physical basis for famine existed in Ukraine. The Ukrainian grain harvest of 1932 had resulted in below-average yields (in part because of the chaos wreaked by the collectivisation campaign), but it was more than sufficient to sustain the population. Nevertheless, Soviet authorities set requisition quotas for Ukraine at an impossibly high level. Brigades of special agents were dispatched to Ukraine to assist in procurement, and homes were routinely searched and foodstuffs confiscated.""
On 23 October 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that recognised the Holodomor as a crime against humanity, caused by the deliberate policies of Stalin's USSR. On 28 April 2010, a Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe resolution declared the famine was caused by the ""cruel and deliberate actions and policies of the Soviet regime"" and was responsible for the deaths of ""millions of innocent people"" in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Russia.

451,UKRAINE’S LAWSUIT AGAINST RUSSIA IS GROUNDLESS,"SUMMARY
Ukraine’s claims about Russia, set forth in a lawsuit at the International Court of Justice, are not substantiated by anything. Kyiv accuses the Kremlin of financing terrorism in the Donbas, but in reality, it was humanitarian convoys with help for the local population.
DISPROOF
This article contains some of the most common disinformation narratives of the Kremlin that there is a “civil war” in the Donbas.
The war in eastern Ukraine is an act of aggression by Russia, which has been going on for five years. Evidence confirms that Russia is sending its mercenaries to Donbas as well as arms. The Russian weapons, including modern sophisticated systems regularly registered by the OSCE SMM, continue to be illegally supplied through the uncontrolled segment of the Ukrainian-Russian state border. Russia has been suspected from the outset of using its so-called ""humanitarian convoys’"" for transporting weapons, ammunition and other supplies to Donbas. 
Ukraine accuses Russia of financing terrorism and violating the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The lawsuit was filed at the International Court of Justice by the then President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, in early 2017. The lawsuit against Russia weighs about 90 kg, consists of 17,500 pages of text and is contained in 29 volumes.

The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy.
Far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. The ""Right Sector""  candidate received 0.7% of the vote in the May 2014 presidential elections, and the party received 1.8% of the vote in the October 2014 parliamentary elections. In 2019 election cycle far-right candidates fell short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.

Recurring narrative about aggressive Ukraine – read similar cases in which it is stated that Ukraine trains terrorists for European and Middle Eastern operations and that US and British instructors teach Ukrainians to carry out terror acts.

458,"THE US HAS WAGED A HYBRID WAR AGAINST BOLIVIA, OUSTING THE LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT","SUMMARY
Bolivia is on the brink of becoming South America’s worst crisis in recent history if the ongoing US-backed hybrid war against its democratically elected and legitimate leadership continues to spiral out of control. President Morales’ razor-thin victory in the first round of last month’s elections was the trigger that “justified” publicly rolling out the preplanned destabilization against him that was being prepared for years already in the event that Latin America’s longest-serving leader sought a fourth term in office.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. No evidence is provided to support the claim.
This is part of a recurrent disinformation narrative about US-led regime change operations against left wing governments in Latin America. You can see other examples of this, such as the alleged presence of a US marine in the Venezuelan barricades and the promotion of a Ukraine-style 'colour revolution', the training of Venezuelan exiles in Guyana for military operations inside the country, preparations for a military intervention after forcing Brazil to join NATO, deliberate blackouts in South America caused by the US, or the existence of plans for the secession of oil-rich regions in both Venezuela and Mexico.

459,"UKRAINE STARTED THE WAR IN DONBAS, IT IS AN AGGRESSOR","SUMMARY
Has Ukraine asked the residents of Donbas to whom it has brought death? Ukraine is an aggressor country that launched a war against the inhabitants of Donbas who had not accepted the coup d’état that the Ukrainians had committed. Ukraine’s Turchinov gave the order to [use the army and] the air forces.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Euromaidan and war in Ukraine. It disregards the extensive factual evidence confirming ongoing Russian military presence in Donbas. There have been many investigations proving Russia's involvement in the war in East Ukraine.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim.
The war in Eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict, but an act of aggression by the Russian armed forces, that has been ongoing since February 2014.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that “the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation"". This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"". At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014 and at successive summits since then, allied leaders also demanded that Russia refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
According to the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Russian special forces and troops operated to mobilise, lead, equip, and support separatist militias in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine from spring 2014 to the present, although their presence was denied by Moscow.
Ukraine began its response to the Russian aggression in Eastern Ukraine on April 13, 2014 after the pro-Russian separatists supported by Moscow took control over several cities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

460,THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS FAILED,"SUMMARY
The European Union has failed and liberalism is in crisis. Among the causes of this failure are globalisation and the negative reactions of society to multiculturalism and immigration.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative demonising the EU, claiming that the EU and EU elites have robbed European states of their sovereignty and are responsible for the impoverishment of European peoples, as well as that the EU is disintegrating.
No evidence given to support the claim that the EU has failed.
The European Parliament’s Spring 2019 Eurobarometer, measuring public attitudes to the EU three months ahead of the European elections, reveals that despite the various internal and external challenges to the EU of the past years, the European sense of togetherness does not seem to have weakened. Continued support for EU membership goes with a strong belief (68%) that EU countries overall have benefited from being part of the EU - equalling the highest level recorded since 1983. In addition, 61% of respondents say their country’s EU membership is a good thing.

DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Ukraine and the war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity are continuously violated by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.",REAL
462,WHAT IS HAPPENING IN UKRAINE IS A WESTERN PROJECT,"SUMMARY
What is happening in Ukraine now is a completely Western project. Co-production from the USA and the EU. They supported the coup in 2014, and dragged Poroshenko, turning a blind eye to everything.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative painting the 2013-14 protests in Kyiv as a coup orchestrated by the West, and alleging that Russia's armed aggression in east Ukraine is a civil war. It's also a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative undermining the statehood of Ukraine. The message also repeats disinformation narratives about EU and US relations with Ukraine.
Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The EU and the US support the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter’s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.
The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014.",REAL
463,UKRAINE IS A COMPLETELY ARTIFICIAL COUNTRY,"SUMMARY
From how many pieces is Ukraine shaped? It is completely artificial. There are Poles, there are Hungarians, there are Romanians, there are Russians. Where is Ukraine?
DISPROOF
Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the history of Ukraine and Ukrainian statehood.
The history of Ukraine dates back to the times of the Kyivan Rus’ in the IX-XIII centuries. As a nation-state, Ukraine was formed during the XVI-XIX centuries when it was divided by major European states: the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita) and the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires. However, in the middle of the XVII century, parts of Ukraine's territories received independence from Poland and created an independent Cossacks Hetmanate. Later, it signed a military and political cooperation deal with Moscow, which was then used by Russian rulers to deprive Hetmanate of its sovereign rights.
In the early XX century, after the collapse of the Russian empire, the Ukrainian People’s Republic was proclaimed. In Western Ukraine, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the Western Ukrainian National Republic was created. On 22 January 1919, the two states signed a Unification Act creating a unified state. Other territories wanted to join the new Ukrainian state, such as Northern Bukovyna and Crimea and appealed to the government of a unified Ukrainian People’s Republic.",REAL
464,EVO MORALES RESIGNATION WAS POSSIBLE ONLY AFTER US INTELLIGENCE INTERFERENCE,"SUMMARY
The hybrid war on Bolivia has thus far succeeded in removing the country’s democratically re-elected and legitimate head of state after President Morales resigned under duress following the military’s “request” that he do so, with this coup being made possible only because US intelligence had already co-opted the armed forces and therefore ensured that this outcome was a fait accompli even before it was officially announced.

466,FRANCE HAS NEVER BEEN A GUARANTOR OF SECURITY,"SUMMARY
Europe is not a trendsetter, and in any case is not an exporter of security. Unlike say, even Turkey. Europe, and France, are far from (standards set by) Russia in terms of bringing security (to a region). Where did France prove itself as a guarantor of security? Which state did France stabilise? Which state has the EU stabilised?
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the EU and European states trying to undermine their role in keeping the world a safe place.
There are other similar cases that ""France and Germany do nothing to enforce respect of the Minsk Agreements by Ukraine"", or that it's ""the Soviet Union who kept the world from complete disaster and complete wildness"". 
France advocates a significantly stronger Defence Europe, as reflected in various frameworks (bilateral and “plurilateral” cooperation between European States, the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation).
Following the Maastricht Treaty, which established the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in 1993, the Franco-British Summit in Saint-Malo laid the foundations for a European defence and security policy in 1998. The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) was created the following year with a view to developing the European Union’s role in managing international crises through humanitarian, evacuation, peacekeeping and intervention tasks (also known as Petersberg tasks).
For example, in 2003, this policy took tangible shape in the field with the Artemis Operation, formally known as the European Union Force (EUFOR) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As part of this operation, which was under French command, 2,300 European soldiers helped stop massacres in Ituri, to the north-east of the country.
The European Intervention Initiative, which was announced by the French President on 26 September 2017 and launched on 25 June 2018, seeks to develop a common European strategic culture. The goal is to build European capacities to jointly conduct military operations and missions, within ad hoc or multilateral frameworks (EU, NATO, UN), for all of the crises capable of affecting European security.",REAL
467,WHITE HELMETS ARE A WING OF TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS IN SYRIA,"SUMMARY
The White Helmets organisation, which presents itself as a structure designed to save the civilian population in war zones, belongs to terrorist groups. The Syrian President announced that Damascus had proof of this. The White Helmets’ activities in Syria represent “communications operations”. This organisation is “a wing of the Front al-Nusra terrorist group”. Among these so-called “angels” of the White Helmets, there are the faces of those who were part of the ranks of Al-Qaeda. There are those who beheaded people and who ate the heart of a dead soldier. All of this can easily be found on the Internet.
In addition, the Russian Diplomacy accused the White Helmets of being part of a disinformation campaign to discredit Russia’s actions in the Idlib de-escalation zone. The organisation is also suspected of being responsible for the provocation that gave the West an excuse to accuse Damascus of using chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Douma in April 2018.
DISPROOF
Recurrent disinformation narrative. Pro-Kremlin media routinely accuse the White Helmets of “working for terrorists” and giving biased information to the Western media. No evidence is given to support these claims.
The ""White Helmets"" movement originated in Syria in 2012. Volunteers save people from the rubble after bombings, despite the danger of dying themselves as a result of repeated air strikes.  Activists have documented the use of chemical weapons in Syria, later confirmed by The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  (OPCW). Because of this, they have become the target of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign.
Thus, OPCW said it found reasonable grounds to believe that chlorine was used as a weapon in the Douma district of Eastern Ghouta, Syria in April 2018.

468,WASHINGTON STAGES COUPS ATTEMPTS AGAINST LEFTIST LEADERS OF LATIN AMERICA,"SUMMARY
The two main [Bolivian] opposition figures Mesa and Camacho are a sort of marriage of business and fascism to pursue pure capitalistic interest, simply because the Morales government was left-wing and rather socialist.
This is typical for the entire region, as attempts against the Nicolas Maduro government in Venezuela are still on-going, for 9 months straight, but with limited, if any, success.

The US let the genie out of the bottle through its long-running Hybrid War on Venezuela, and although it’s solidifying its newly established control over Bolivia right now, it lost control of the protest dynamics in Peru, Ecuador, and Chile, and its man in Argentina just lost reelection.
It’s difficult to imagine why Brazil would be immune to this trend considering that it’s already so sharply divided and even the slightest spark might set into motion very similar events as elsewhere in the region, which is why Bolsonaro must be anxiously sweating right now praying that he won’t become the most prominent example of the US’ Hybrid War blowback in the hemisphere.

Ukraine in its lawsuit, appeal to two major conventions: the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. November 8 Court of Justice has confirmed that it may consider the claim and rejected all objections to Russia an unprecedented number of votes. Thus, in a further ICJ can proceed to the consideration of the merits. According to the Deputy Foreign Minister for European Integration of Ukraine Elena mirror, a final judgment in the case of Ukraine against Russia can be expected no earlier than the end of 2022 due to procedural conditions.
""If the count according to the established practice of the Court, in December of next year Russia should apply approximately the same number of documents to the court. The court must give us the right to study and the response to these documents. Usually it is three to four months. If there is such an amount can be up to six months. After our reaction will give some time for the Russian reaction to our reaction, and after that will be assigned to the hearing. Indeed, the decision is not expected before 2022, and possibly the beginning of 2023 "", - said mirror (Video 30: 48-31.36). Also, the deputy minister stressed that Russia will continue to adhere to their propaganda point of view on everything that happens in the Donbas, spreading narratives of ""civil war"" in Ukraine and the ""rebels miners with Soviet weapons."" According to Elena mirror, Russia may continue to submit false information about arms shipments to the Donbass and terrorist acts.
""Of course, they may resort to its normal practice: the first - is the legal gymnastics to prove that the"" Buk ""they supplied, not realizing that he could shoot at civilian aircraft. Of course, they can continue to tell me that the weapons and ""Grad"" was in the mines, but it is not just a part of the Russian propaganda, and they actually have disgraced themselves by providing such evidence and such a position in the court.

As for the so-called ""humanitarian convoy"" Russia for Donbass, then this ""help"" has been repeatedly condemned the Ukrainian authorities and international observers and European leadership. During the war, it has repeatedly recorded that Russian weapons still illegally shipped through uncontrolled portion of the Ukrainian-Russian state border. Russia from the very beginning was suspected of using so-called ""humanitarian convoy"" for the transportation of weapons, ammunition and other supplies in the Donbass. In this regard, Ukraine accuses Russia of arming and funding militants in Donbas, in a plane crash Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in shelling residential areas of Mariupol and Kramatorsk, in the destruction of the civilian passenger bus near Volnovakha, as well as a ban on the activities of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people. Earlier, the International Court of Justice granted the part of Ukraine demands to Russia in one of the Conventions - the Convention on the prohibition of racial discrimination.

489,THE US CONSIDERS THE EU AS A KIND OF PROTECTORATE,"SUMMARY
The US has long regarded the EU as a kind of protectorate. The Balkans are used as a “trigger” to set Europe on fire at any time. It is obvious that any attempt by any [European] political leader to present himself as an important actor will be met with discontent in Washington. The US perceives the EU as an association under its military, political and, in part, economic influence. That was also after Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron tried to push through the idea of a European army, which is a thorn in the side of the Americans.
The US imposed a military organisation in the form of NATO on Europe, and it does not benefit the EU. The US has such a dominant position and does not want its influence on the EU to diminish. The Balkans are being used for this purpose.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about US presence in Europe, portraying Europe as a vassal of the USA and trying to undermine the sovereignty of Western Europe. Pro-Kremlin disinformation sources often claim that the EU is trying to break out of Washington’s control and occupation and that the US intends to “discipline the EU” from the position of a senior partner.
In fact, the EU Member States are sovereign countries and make sovereign decisions about their own security and policies. US/ NATO military presence and support in the EU Member States is possible only on the basis of the clear request/ consent of the hosting nation. The US is an important ally to the EU but EU policy is not determined by the US, as explained by the EU High Representative.
Each country, including Albania and North Macedonia, could make their sovereign decision to host NATO/US military forces on their land. NATO membership is open to any European state in a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area. All NATO members have made sovereign decisions to join the alliance so far. NATO decisions are made by consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries.",REAL
490,"IT IS RATHER NICE FOR A JOURNALIST TO WORK IN RUSSIA, UNLIKE IN EUROPE
","SUMMARY
Even if everything is not perfect, the situation of press freedom in Russia is not as black as some people want to portray it. In general, it is rather nice for a journalist to work in Russia. Many information and public registers are accessible, which facilitates the work of investigative journalists.
Whilst Russia is often singled out in this area, take the recent example of Russian media being refused accreditation for a conference in Britain precisely on the topics of press freedom. These kinds of decisions only weaken international standards of freedom of information.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on the Western media not being independent and biased while Russia protects freedom of speech and the press.
As for the non-admission of Russian disinformation outlets to the conference on freedom of speech in the UK, RT and Sputnik were the only Russian media banned from the conference for an ""over active role in spreading disinformation''. Other Russian media were accredited and attended.

491,POLAND MAY END UP BEING PARTITIONED BETWEEN GERMANY AND RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
With the ultimate aim to ruin the Belarus-Russia integration process and to bring Belarus closer to Poland, Warsaw is changing the ways of working with the Belarusian opposition. Polish security bodies are currently placing a greater emphasis on Belarusian informants. At the same time, NATO aims at constraining Belarus’ allied commitments towards Russia and at ruling out Belarus’ activities in case of NATO threat to the Kaliningrad region. Americans pressure Belarus to take a passive position in the possible NATO-Russia conflict. Taken together, enforcement of NATO military grouping along Belarusian borders and Polish elites’ attempts to bring discord in Belarus-Russia relations aim at distracting Belarusian resources from the economic sector to defence.
Polish foreign policy is generally very cyclical. As a rule, it tried to build an anti-Russian bastion in Europe based on foreign actors, be it Vatican, Sweden, France, UK, or the US. Each time these attempts ended with Poland’s collapse and country partitions. This can happen once again. Polish efforts to militarise Eastern Europe and to attract US’s attention to the region provoke Berlin’s discontent. German diplomats even joke that if things continue developing in this way, Germans will have no choice but to agree with the Russians once again and to partition the Polish state.
DISPROOF
This publication is a mix of conspiracy theories and groundless generalisations aimed to discredit Poland's foreign and security policies, Germany, the West and NATO as anti-Russian belligerent actors aimed at disrupting Belarus-Russia relations and counteracting the Union State between Belarus and Russia. It is also consistent with a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the US presence in Europe. Furthermore, it puts forward an offensive remark to the German side alleging that Berlin may accept Poland's partition in coordination with Russia following a hypothetical NATO military actions against Russia.
Germany and Poland are both members of NATO. NATO is a defensive alliance and does not pose a threat to Russia. Its purpose is to protect its member states. Every country that joins NATO undertakes to uphold its principles and policies, and this includes the commitment that ""the Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia,"" as reaffirmed at the Brussels Summit.

493,KYIV REFUSES TO CLEAR UP ITS MINES IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
Ukraine is refusing to clear up mines in Donbas and therefore Finland will have to do it. After Kyiv refused to finance the clearing of mines left by Ukrainian soldiers, Finland has taken on the task.
DISPROOF
Another narrative attempting to portray Ukraine as a failing state. See recent EUvsDisinfo article Ukraine is attacked again. And again.
Ukraine has never refused to clear mines in the Donbas war zone. Mine clearance is conducted simultaneously by Ukraine’s Armed Forces, the State Special Transport Service and the Emergency Situation Service. In addition, since 2016 several international organisations have been helping with mine clearance in Ukraine such as the Halo Trust, the Danish Demining Group, and the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action.
In 2005, Ukraine became a signatory to the Ottawa Convention or the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty and since 2012 has continued to dispose of prohibited explosive devices. In January 2019, a new law on mine safety and clearance came into force. The law states that anti-mine and clearance programmes will be financed through the state budget along with donor funds.
Finland’s Foreign Ministry has confirmed that they are ready to allocate 600,000 euros for mine clearing in Donbas. In addition to Finland, over the last year Great Britain, Germany, NATO and others have provided financial assistance for mine clearing programs in Ukraine.",REAL
494,HITLER’S NAZI OFFICIALS ARE NOT LESS BELARUSIAN HEROES THAN KALINOWSKI,"SUMMARY
Some people name Kalinowski a Belarusian national hero. Recently Belarusian foreign minister Uladzimir Makei said that Kalinowski belongs to Belarusian history and that he is a figure in Lithuanian and Polish history as well. This is an awful logic. It implies that fascist collaborators are Belarusian heroes too, just as Wilhelm Kube [Nazi senior official in the occupying government of the Soviet Union with the rank of Generalkommissar for Weissruthenien], a Hitler’s executioner of the Belarusian people in the WWII. A sacramental question to the foreign minister is the following: Won’t the participation of Belarusian delegation in the reburial ceremony of Kalinowski remnants be a justification of Polish gentry activities to turn Belarusian lands into the eastern part of Poland?
DISPROOF
This publication puts forward an absurd parallel between Belarusian, Lithuanian and Polish national hero Kalinowski and Wilhelm Kube, the head of the Nazi occupational body in Belarus during the WWII, aimed to discredit Belarusian history. It is consistent with the recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about Western aggressive activities towards Belarus and its history.
Wincenty Konstanty Kalinowski, also known as Kastuś Kalinoŭski was a 19th-century writer, lawyer and revolutionary. As one of the leaders of the Belarusian, Lithuanian and Polish national revival and the leader of the 1863-1864 uprising (also known as January uprising) against Imperial Russia, Kalinowski is considered a national hero in Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. The monument to Kalinowski in the Belarusian town of Svislach where Kalinowski graduated from a local school was established in 1958.
In 2017-18 Lithuanian archaeologists found the remains of Kalinowski and other leaders of the uprising in the centre of Vilnius. The Lithuanian authorities plan to organize a reburial ceremony at the end of November 2019 and to open a monument to the January uprising. In response to an appeal by Belarusian public figures to the Lithuanian state, the Lithuanian government stated it plans that the inscriptions on the monument will be in Belarusian, Lithuanian and Polish.
See earlier disinformation cases claiming that the West and Russophobia advocates selected the little-known terrorist Kalinowski as a Belarusian national hero, to promote terrorism and that Lithuania does not want to take Kalinowski’s DNA test to avoid a blunder as it can turn out that the remains belong to a different person.",REAL
495,UKRAINE IS THE MOST FAILED ECONOMY ON EARTH,"SUMMARY
Ukraine is the most failed economy on planet Earth; the only country where the GDP level decreased by 30 percent in comparison with the situation 30 years ago.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremling disinformation narrative portraying the economic situation of Ukraine as disastrous and blaming various international actors - EU, IMF - never Russia, for this state of affairs.
According to the World Bank, the GDP of Ukraine grew by 3.5 percent in the first half of 2019 compared to 3.3 percent in 2018. The solid growth was driven by a strong agricultural harvest as well as sectors dependent on domestic demand, including services (domestic trade, transport, and the financial sector) and construction.
In 2019 the GDP of Ukraine is 130,832 billion USD. Thirty years ago it was 82,709 billion USD - an increase of over 50 percent.
Ukraine’s economic freedom score is 52.3, making its economy the 147th freest out of 180 other countries in the 2019 Index of The Heritage Foundation.",REAL
496,THE WHITE HELMETS ARE IN FAIRLY CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE TOP OF THE TERRORIST GROUPS,"SUMMARY
The Syrian Civil Defense opposition organisation (White Helmets) is in close contact with Western intelligence agencies. The Mayday Rescue fund, registered in the Netherlands, was the “cover” for contacts and financing the provocateur organisation. Moreover, White Helmets are in rather close contact with the top of terrorist groups.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the association of the White Helmets with terrorism in Syria.
The White Helmets are a volunteer search and rescue organisation made up of a group of Syrian civilians who mobilized to help war casualties in Syria, namely injured civilians trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings. The organisation - which is made up of 3,400 volunteers including teachers, engineers, tailors and firefighters - states that it has no affiliation to any political or military actor and is committed to render services to anyone in need.
The claim that the White Helmets are the creation of “Western intelligence” is unsubstantiated and constitutes a groundless conspiracy theory.  Mayday rescue supports White Helmets to provide a wide range of emergency and life-sustaining essential services to approximately 3.5m civilians inside Syria including firefighting, ambulance, urban search and rescue, support to internally displaced people, explosive hazard clearance, essential utilities repair and rubble clearance.
Disinformation media routinely accuse White Helmets of “working for terrorists” and giving a biased information to Western media. No evidence is given to support those claims.
See the similar case accusing White Helmets for being the “a wing of the Front al-Nusra terrorist group”.

497,WHITE HELMETS WERE INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF VIDEOS OF STAGED “CHEMICAL ATTACKS”,"SUMMARY
Western Media told fairy tales of tens and hundreds of thousands of people supposedly saved from chemical attacks of Damascus. But actually the White Helmets were mainly involved in the production of fake videos of staged “chemical attacks”, for example in Khan Sheikhoun in 2017 or in Douma in 2018.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narratives aiming to discredit the White Helmets and claiming that the Khan Shaykhun and Douma chemical attacks were staged by Western actors in order to justify military action against the Assad regime.
The OPCW’s Fact Finding Mission confirmed that people in Khan Shaykhun were exposed to sarin, a chemical weapon, on 4 April 2017. ""The OPCW FFM has confirmed the use of sarin, a nerve agent, during the 4 April incident in Khan Shaykhun in Syria,” mentioned its Director-General in a report published on June 30, 2017.
The UN-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism found Syria’s Government responsible for the attack in Khan Shaykhun. On April 2018, Russia vetoed a US-drafted UN Security Council resolution that would have created a new inquiry to ascertain responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. In June, the OPCW members granted it power to assign responsibility for chemical attacks.
The United Nations Human Rights Council stated that the Syrian government forces are responsible for the attack. “Government forces continued to deliberately target civilians, including through the use of chemical weapons against civilians in opposition-held areas. As part of an aerial campaign in northern Hama and southern Idlib, on 4 April the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, killing over 80 people, most of whom were women and children,” says the report. Syrian government forces and their ally Russia continue to deny these facts.",REAL
498,THE US OVERTHREW BOLIVIAN PRESIDENT BY A MILITARY JUNTA WHEN MAIDAN TECHNIQUES DID NOT HELP,"SUMMARY
Bolivian events indicate that Western elites have become hysterical because they increasingly lose control in various regions of the world which they considered their backyard for a long time. In the countries where the heads of state cannot be removed from office thanks to pressure and Maidans, they apply military junta scenarios which were characteristic for the mid-XX century. In case these scenarios stop working too, the US will turn to “gunboat diplomacy” with marine unites’ operations on the territories of the countries which do not want to share their fortunes with the US.
During his presidency, Morales developed closer relations with China and Russia at the expense of relationship with the US. Morales did not step down after organised criminal groups took to the streets and started attacking electoral authorities. When it became apparent that a colour revolution was not succeeding, Bolivian police and army stepped in against Morales. Hence, as a classic colour revolution technique failed due to the absence of popular support, the coup organisers resorted to the military coup scenario which was very popular among US security bodies in the 20th century.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory to support the claim of US-inspired anti-Morales coup, which is consistent with pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative attempting to deny the existence of genuine grass-roots protests, portraying them as foreign-led efforts and fake colour revolutions.
This is also a part of a recurrent disinformation narrative about US-led regime change operations against left-wing governments in Latin America. You can see other examples of this, such as the alleged presence of a US marine in the Venezuelan barricades and the promotion of a Ukraine-style 'colour revolution', preparations for a military intervention after forcing Brazil to join NATO, deliberate blackouts in South America caused by the US, or the existence of plans for the secession of oil-rich regions in both Venezuela and Mexico.

DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that Ukraine is a Russophobic country and that decommunisation is directed against Russia.
The law on decommunisation initiated by the Cabinet of Ministers came into force in Ukraine in 2015.

500,THE US USES POLAND AS A POTENTIAL FUSE AND STIMULATOR OF A CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
The US needed Poland only in case of a direct confrontation with the Russian Federation, as a potential catalyst or stimulator of the conflict. It is clear that Poland is not aware of its role, and of the fact that it will be written off.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on “lost sovereignty”.
Poland is often presented as a “puppet-state” of the United States. This narrative includes a message that the United States manipulates Poland and other European allies in order to carry out its anti-Russian policies.
The statement that Poland is used by the United States to inspire a conflict with Russia is a conspiracy theory. Poland is a sovereign state, which shapes its own foreign and domestic policies.

The colour revolutions have been promoted by democracy-obsessed neo-liberal Western elites who aim to export by any means the model of society they prefer, including through war. These Western-backed color revolutions have provoked devastating consequences for the local populations.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative presenting colour revolutions as attempts by the West to overthrow regimes in post-Soviet states and in other regions.
This narrative portrays any spontaneous disorders and civil uprisings in other states, especially the former Soviet republics, as West-funded ""colour revolutions"".

502,THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BERLIN WALL WAS ALSO DESIRED BY THE WESTERN POWERS,"SUMMARY
The construction of the Berlin Wall was also desired by the Western powers.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative involving historical revisionism.
Communist East German authorities built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to stop the flow of residents into the democratic, and free, West. For almost 30 years, the Berlin Wall separated West Berlin from the East German state, the GDR, which was in the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union. Read more about the Berlin Wall here.
Western powers and NATO Allies opposed the Wall from the beginning. In December 1961, just a few months after construction of the Wall had started, NATO foreign ministers “reaffirmed the determination to protect and defend the liberties of West Berlin and ensure to its people the conditions for a free and prosperous life.”",REAL
503,WHITE HELMETS WAS CREATED BY WESTERN SECURITY BODIES AND HAS CONNECTIONS WITH TERRORISTS,"SUMMARY
White Helmets was set up in 2013 by a former UK’s army officer James Le Mesurier. In fact it was created by Western countries’ security bodies. The organization received Western financial assistance and declared protection of peaceful population in the military action zones as its aim, but is blamed by the Syrian authorities in connections with extremists and hostile propaganda. It is said that some public videos capture Al-Qaeda members who beheaded people and ate killed soldier’s heart as White Helmets participants and the organization is a wing of Al-Nusra terrorist group.
Russian MFA called White Helmets’  activities us an element of information campaign to discredit Syrian authorities. Russia also blamed White Helmets for the provocation which gave the West a reason to accuse Damask for using chemical weapons and to attack the governmental military forces. Russian side also stated that James Le Mesurier was a MI6 officer who was seen in many conflicts around the world, including in Kosovo and the Near East.
DISPROOF
This publication is an illustrative example of many disinformation and propagandistic claims about the White Helmets. Pro-Kremlin media routinely accuse the White Helmets of “working for terrorists” and giving biased information to the Western media. No evidence is given to support these claims.
The ""White Helmets"" movement originated in Syria in 2012. The organisation - which is made up of 3,400 volunteers including teachers, engineers, tailors and firefighters - states that it has no affiliation to any political or military actor and is committed to render services to anyone in need. Volunteers save people from the rubble after bombings, despite the danger of dying themselves as a result of repeated air strikes.
White Helmets activists have documented the use of chemical weapons in Syria, later confirmed by The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  (OPCW). Thus, OPCW said it found reasonable grounds to believe that chlorine was used as a weapon in the Douma district of Eastern Ghouta, Syria in April 2018. Because of its activities, the organization has become the target of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign. .

504,US WANTS TO PROVOKE NEW RELIGIOUS WARS IN THE WORLD,"SUMMARY
The idea of ​​the United States is to begin an era of religious conflicts and sectarian wars. Because religious wars are the most severe, uncompromising and even the bloodiest, Washington will use the economic factor. For example, programmes to help “favourite” representatives of religious denominations. The plan is humanitarian assistance to countries, but the US can expand these programmes to include military support.
DISPROOF
A conspiracy theory presented without any evidence and a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Western attempts to instigate colour revolutions and wars in the world. See here for the most common pro-Kremlin narratives.
USAID announced in September new financial assistance to support ethnic and religious minorities displaced by the genocide perpetrated by the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Beneficiaries will include displaced people who are living in camps and non-camp locations in Northern Iraq, as well as disadvantaged members of host communities. The activity will fund two stationary clinics and one mobile medical team. There is no evidence to support the claim that humanitarian aid will be followed by military support.

508,NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN 2016 US ELECTION,"SUMMARY
Hillary Clinton has repeatedly laid responsibility for her defeat in the 2016 presidential election on “Russian interference” that helped her opponent. Her claims have never been corroborated by any evidence.
Additionally, in April 2019 Special Counsel Robert Mueller stated that he had found insubstantial evidence to prove that Trump had colluded with the Kremlin.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation denying Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election in particular, and whitewashing the Kremlin's meddling in Western democratic processes generally.
Available evidence suggests that Russian meddling the 2016 US presidential poll - which specifically aimed to damage Clinton's campaign and aid her opponent - did affect the outcome of the vote, particularly in three critical swing states where Trump's victory margins were the thinnest.
The claim that the Special Counsel report provides no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion is spurious. Gathering evidence of ""collusion"" - which is not a legal concept - fell outside the scope of the investigation. The aim of the probe was not merely to ascertain contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia-linked individuals during the election period, but to establish whether these interactions were deliberate enough on the part of Trump Campaign officials to sustain charges of conspiracy (p. 2).
The report explicitly identifies ""numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"" (p. 9).",REAL
509,THE COUP IN BOLIVIA RESEMBLES OTHER COLOUR REVOLUTIONS,"SUMMARY
For Washington, Bolivia is another point on the map where the military coup ended successfully. In an official statement, Trump already noted two new goals – Venezuela and Nicaragua. The coup in Bolivia resembles other colour revolutions.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory with no evidence given. It is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about alleged US-led regime change operations in Latin America. Examples include the alleged presence of a US marine in the Venezuelan barricades and the promotion of a Ukraine-style 'colour revolution', the training of Venezuelan exiles in Guyana for military operations inside the country, preparations for a military intervention after forcing Brazil to join NATO, deliberate blackouts in South America caused by the US, or the existence of plans for the secession of oil-rich regions in both Venezuela and Mexico.

510,BRITISH WARSHIP RICHMOND THREATENED RUSSIAN NAVY,"SUMMARY
In 2017, the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov was on its way to Syria accompanied by battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy. During this trip, British warship HMS Richmond openly and impudently tried to take a place in the column of Russian aircraft carriers driven by its “banal curiosity.” Ultimately, the Russian warship crossed Richmond’s route, prompting the British warship to retreat. This is yet another example of “Battle of Russian and NATO Navies.”
DISPROOF
This is an example of a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about NATO countries' aggression towards Russia.
The footage is from 2017, revived by News Front Georgia to portray the advantage of Russia's navy over that of NATO countries'.
The British warship HMS Richmond had been tracking the movement of Russian vessels since 2016 and Russia was informed about it. Both the BBC and The Guardian reported that in 2016, the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and its task force, including the nuclear-powered battle cruiser Peter the Great, left Russia for Syria. The carrier and its task force were sailing south from the Norwegian Sea on their way to Syria, passing near British territorial waters. Since the Russian warships planned to pass through the English Channel, British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the ships would be “man-marked” every step of the way (see BBC article above).
Moreover, the story is not supported with actual footage of the so-called confrontation between Richmond and Peter the Great. Instead, the article is accompanied by a general video of these warships and car racing.",REAL
511,CRIMEA BECAME RUSSIAN AFTER ITS RESIDENTS VOTED FOR REUNIFICATION WITH RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Crimea became a Russian region after a referendum held there in March 2014, where most residents spoke out in favour of reunification with Russia.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal annexation of Crimea.
No international body has recognised the so-called referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014, which was organised by self-proclaimed Crimean leadership lacking democratic legitimacy and installed by armed Russian military personnel following the seizure of public buildings.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.""
On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
The EU's policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity. In March 2019, on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.",REAL

The US controls “disobedient countries” in Latin America by organising coups, bribing corrupt politicians and financing pro-American-leaning opposition groups.
The Bolivian Revolution is very similar in character to the Ukrainian “Orange Revolution” and “Euromaidan” and it is clear that the US is behind it as the main creator of colour revolutions.

513,"NATO EXERCISES IN LITHUANIA, NAMED AFTER A LITHUANIAN FASCIST GROUP, AIM TO PROVOKE RUSSIA","SUMMARY
NATO exercises in Lithuania, named after a Lithuanian fascist armed group, try to provoke and frighten Russia.
NATO has always known how to “dignify” historical events in an infamous way. Germany had joined NATO on 9 May 1955 – exactly ten years after the Russian day of victory over fascism. Will all right-wing radicals in the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence want to take revenge on Moscow by naming NATO’s military exercises after a fascist armed group? No one can tell that this was not meant to be a deliberate provocation.
Germany, along with ten other NATO countries, is also participating in the manoeuvres, which apparently serve to deter Russia in the region.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on NATO belligerence towards Russia and on Russophobia.
NATO does not provoke Russia with its military exercises in the Baltic states. NATO's presence in the region is at the request of the host nations and enjoys significant public support. A 2016 Gallup poll found that most people in Allied countries in the Baltic region associate NATO with the protection of their country. NATO forces uphold the highest standards of conduct, both on and off duty.
Moreover, NATO seeks no confrontation with Russia. NATO is a defensive alliance. Its purpose is to protect the member states. NATO's exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia – or any other country. NATO has reached out to Russia consistently, transparently and publicly over the past 29 years. NATO enlargement has brought more stability and prosperity to Europe, including Russia.
The name of the exercises, ""Iron Wolf"", has nothing to do with Nazi or Fascist ideology. The Iron Wolf is a mythical character from a medieval legend of the founding of the city of Vilnius. This name is held by one of the most important units of the Lithuanian Army - Mechanised Infantry Brigade “Iron Wolf”.

Will all right-wing radicals in the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence want to take revenge on Moscow by naming NATO’s military exercises after a fascist armed group? No one can tell that this was not meant to be a deliberate provocation.
Germany, along with ten other NATO countries, is also participating in the manoeuvres, which apparently serve to deter Russia in the region.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on NATO belligerence towards Russia and on Russophobia.
NATO does not provoke Russia with its military exercises in the Baltic states. NATO's presence in the region is at the request of the host nations and enjoys significant public support. A 2016 Gallup poll found that most people in Allied countries in the Baltic region associate NATO with the protection of their country. NATO forces uphold the highest standards of conduct, both on and off duty.
Moreover, NATO seeks no confrontation with Russia. NATO is a defensive alliance. Its purpose is to protect the member states. NATO's exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia – or any other country. NATO has reached out to Russia consistently, transparently and publicly over the past 29 years. NATO enlargement has brought more stability and prosperity to Europe, including Russia.
The name of the exercises, ""Iron Wolf"", has nothing to do with Nazi or Fascist ideology. The Iron Wolf is a mythical character from a medieval legend of the founding of the city of Vilnius. This name is held by one of the most important units of the Lithuanian Army - Mechanised Infantry Brigade “Iron Wolf”.

515,"BOLIVIA BECAME A US TARGET BECAUSE OF ITS LITHIUM RESERVES
","SUMMARY
Bolivia has one of the world’s largest lithium reserves, thus making it disproportionately strategic. In hindsight, it therefore wasn’t surprising at all that the US would target Bolivia for regime change since it always wanted to dominate the global lithium industry and create a geo-strategic wedge for perpetuating its historic divide-and-rule policy in South America, both of which are in the process of being accomplished after the recent military coup.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. No evidence is provided to support the claim.
This is part of a recurrent disinformation narrative about US-led regime change operations against left wing governments in Latin America. Here are such as the alleged presence of a US marine in the Venezuelan barricades and the promotion of a Ukraine-style 'colour revolution', the training of Venezuelan exiles in Guyana for military operations inside the country, preparations for a military intervention after forcing Brazil to join NATO, deliberate blackouts in South America caused by the US, or the existence of plans for the secession of oil-rich regions in both Venezuela and Mexico.
This narrative also falls within the broader pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative attempting to deny the existence of genuine grass-root protests, portraying them as foreign-led efforts and fake colour revolutions.

516,"EUROPEAN COUNTRIES GLORIFY FASCISM, BUT BALTIC STATES ARE WORSE","SUMMARY
In several European countries, a glorification of fascism is going on. But the worst is what is happening in the Baltic countries. The nationalists seized power in the Baltic States after the collapse of the USSR. As a result, they do everything to forget the best things that connected the people of Russia and the Baltic countries. The friendship, cooperation, prosperity, the centuries-old defence against attacks from aggressors. Instead, they revive those, who together with the Germans, killed their own citizens in the camps.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative attempting to link the Baltic countries with Nazism. This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism. It tries to promote the idea that there was no Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, portraying Russia and the Soviet Union as the only guarantor of security in the Baltic States and that the Baltic States benefited from the Molotov- Ribbentrop pact.
The USSR occupied the Baltic States two times, firstly in 1940, under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, then in 1944. Contrary to the claims of the pro-Kremlin media, the re-capturing of the Baltic States did not bring freedom and prosperity, but Soviet repressions and occupation, which lasted for 50 years. The estimated war and occupation deaths are at 90,000 in Estonia, 180,000 in Latvia and 250,000 in Lithuania. Furthermore, it has been estimated that between 1946 and 1953, deportations and guerrilla deaths reached 95,000 in Estonia,125,000 in Latvia and 310,000 in Lithuania.
The threat of Nazism is a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative; see here for disinformation cases about Europe becoming Nazi again, Baltic states openly glorifying Nazism, Poles stoking nationalist sentiment in Ukraine in order to annex Kviv and that the EU continues the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany.
The accusation of Nazism is one of the favourite techniques of pro-Kremlin outlets as explained in our past analysis Nazi east, Nazi west, Nazi over the cuckoo's nest.",REAL
517,"UKRAINIANS RUINED THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE AND THE USSR, THE US IS NEXT","SUMMARY
Ukraine is capable of ruining many empires. A great deal of the Russian empire collapse was brought by intrigues played by the empire’s ruling elites, originating in Ukraine. Dnepropetrovsk dynasty was governing the USSR. Once Ukrainian elites moved to the US’s camp, an awful conflict among American elites has emerged. Whereas we follow the Ukrainian crisis as a civil war of our close people, Americans treat Ukraine as Guatemala or any other colony and protectorate. Suddenly it turned out that Ukrainian elites can influence US domestic policies. It all started when Petro Poroshenko finished off Trump’s consultant Paul Manafort.
DISPROOF
This is a mix of conspiracies and ungrounded historical generalizations aimed to discredit Ukraine, Ukrainian statehood, and Ukrainians. It also follows recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about Ukraine as US's colony and a puppet state, a civil war in Ukraine, and US's meddling into Ukrainian elections because of Poroshenko-Manafort story.
It is a conspiracy and simplification to consider Ukraine and the persons originated on its territory as the main drivers for the downfall of Russian empire or the USSR. Historians agree that the Russian empire collapsed during the February Revolution of 1917, largely as a result of massive failures such as hunger, because of its participation in the WWI. There were many factors that led to the collapse of the USSR beyond the alleged mismanagement of the ruling Dnevpropetrovsk clan, such as political policies, economics, defense spending, and the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, etc.
Mueller's 448-page report though mentions Ukraine a dozen of times, mostly in a part which assesses Paul Manafort's ties to Russia and Ukraine, and does not contain a single mention of Petro Poroshenko.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that one of two main reasons behind Poroshenko's loss in presidential elections was the arrest of Trump’s lawyer Paul Manafort, that the US introduced anti-Russian sanctions in exchange for anti-Trump kompromat by Poroshenko team, and that Ukrainian elections are a competition among Washington’s puppets.",REAL
518,THE EU’S IMPERIALISM PROMOTES MIGRATION,"SUMMARY
Erosion of national states was artificially promoted and accelerated in Europe. Growing migration in the EU is a consequence of its capitalist and imperial integration.
Russophobia as a phenomenon came to existence after the 1917 October revolution, when Russia became Soviet. Its very existence was undermining the foundations of power in the US. Despite this historical stage being over, nowadays Russophobia is continuously applied towards Russians.
DISPROOF
This article puts forward a mix of conspiracy theories and groundless generalisations, aimed to present the EU in a bad light compared to Russia.
Growing volumes of regular migration in the EU is a result of deliberate economic policies, while an influx of refugees to the EU in the last years resulted largely from wars and violence in a number of distant countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Eritrea.

DISPROOF
The claim advances recurring pro-Kremlin narratives painting the White Helmets as a Western-backed terrorist proxy and, implicitly, denying the responsibility of the Assad regime for chemical attacks perpetrated during the Syrian civil war.
The ""repeated accusations"" linking the White Helmets to chemical attacks feature heavily in pro-Kremlin coverage of the Syrian conflict and are never accompanied by evidence.

521,"2014 COUP IN KYIV LED TO CRIMEA REFERENDUM, DONBAS WAR","SUMMARY
In 2014, Ukraine was rocked by mass rallies and experienced a coup d’état in Kiev which forced president Viktor Yanukovych to flee the country.
In the wake of this, Crimea rejoined Russia following a March referendum on the peninsula, with 96 percent voting for reunification, while Donetsk and Lugansk declared their independence and refused to obey the new government in Kyiv.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Euromaidan, the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the war in Ukraine.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk of this disinformation claim here.
No international body has recognised the so-called Crimea referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014. Thirteen members of the United Nations Security Council voted in favour of a resolution declaring the referendum invalid. On the 27th of March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On December 17, 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea. On the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the landgrab and continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

522,TWITTER CAMPAIGN AGAINST EVO MORALES MAY BE RUN BY THE CIA,"SUMMARY
The same day of the coup against Evo Morales, thousands of automatised Twitter accounts with none, or just one follower, started promoting the hashtag #BoliviaNoHayGolpe (#BoliviaThereIsNoCoup). The hashtag wasn’t generated in a region with a strong Bolivian community but in the US state of Virginia, home of the CIA, which may point to its involvement.
DISPROOF
Though the existence of automatised bots and false accounts involved in the situation in Bolivia has been proven, the second part of the story is not true. The whole report is based on a tweet by US journalist Alan MacLeod, who pointed out that the hashtag #BoliviaNoHayGolpe (#BoliviaThereIsNoCoup) was ""trending in Virginia, home of the CIA"". But while he said in a subsequent tweet that there is a strong Bolivian community living in Arlington (indeed, one of the biggest in the US), which may easily explain the Twitter trend, RT ignored it and decided instead to push these allegations to promote its narrative of a US-backed coup in Bolivia. It is highly unlikely that a covert campaign carried out by a professional intelligence service could be so easily traced to its geographical origin. 
The story also falls within the broader pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative attempting to deny the existence of genuine grass-root protests, portraying them as foreign-led efforts and fake colour revolutions. You can see other examples of disinformation cases such as a US hybrid war against Bolivia, the recruitment of its security services or the application in the country of the lessons learnt in Venezuela.

525,"ONLY THE KYIV PUTSCHISTS, THE WEST AND THEIR SECRET SERVICES HAD AN INTEREST IN SHOOTING DOWN MH17","SUMMARY
Why are there no calls for investigators to testify about the involvement of Western secret services in the shooting down of MH17? The Western secret services also organised a coup in Ukraine.
The Russian President and Russia were not interested in shooting down the Boeing and killing hundreds of people, it is illogical to think Russia has anything to do with the shot down. Only thy Kyiv putschists, who came to power in Ukraine, had an interest in shooting down MH17. Ukraine needed an incident like MH17, to be loved and cared for in the West. Only the tolerant, democratic, white and fluffy, unaccountable West profited from the downing of the Boeing and threw everything at Russia.
DISPROOF
Combination of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the downing of flight MH17, including a longstanding pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Ukraine's Euromaidan protests, as well as painting the West as the puppet-master of Ukrainian politics and portraying Ukraine as an anti-Russian project.
The JIT has provided concrete evidence of Russia's involvement in the MH17 shot down. On the 28th of September 2016, the JIT announced that flight MH17 was shot down by a missile from the 9M38 series, which was launched by a BUK TELAR missile system. The system was transported from the Russian Federation to an agricultural field near the town of Pervomaiskyi in Eastern Ukraine, where the missile was launched. After firing, the BUK TELAR was transported back to the Russian Federation (with one missing missile). On the 24th of May 2018, the JIT announced that the BUK TELAR came from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade, a unit of the Russian armed forces from Kursk in the Russian Federation. On the basis of the JIT’s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the BUK installation - both governments are formally holding Russia accountable. The JIT conclusions were further corroborated by the Bellingcat Investigation Team. On the 14th November 2019, the JIT released several intercepted telephone calls, revealing details about secure means of communication used between DPR fighters and Russian officials. The telephone numbers that were used are from the same series and appear to be provided by the Russian security service FSB.
As for the disinformation narratives about the Euromaidan: the spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. The protesters' demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence - as can be read here.

526,"MH17: JIT-INVESTIGATION NOT INTERESTED IN TRUTH, BUK BELONGED TO THE UKRAINIAN ARMY","SUMMARY
Based on the activities of the JIT investigation team, it became clear that revealing of the truth about the crash is not the goal of the experts.
The information that the Buk-missile with the serial number 8869032 was transferred to a military unit in Ukraine during Soviet times was not verified.
Instead of real evidence, the “experts” of the international investigation team JIT presented only dubious photos and videos of unknown origin that could not confirm the advertised version of Russia’s guilt.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory claiming that the Ukrainian side was involved in the shooting down the MH17, with no evidence provided. An example of the many competing and occasionally contradictory stories around the downing of flight MH17.
The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation.
In September 2016, the JIT disclosed that MH17 was downed with a BUK missile of the 9M38 series. In Eastern Ukraine, two parts of such a missile were found. These parts are the so-called ‘venturi’ and the ‘casing’. This regards, on the one hand, the exhaust of the missile (venturi) and on the other hand the casing of the missile engine (casing). The missile engine’s casing shows the number 9 д 1318869032. The JIT-investigation up to now has found that 9д 131 relates to the number of the missile engine of the 9M38 type and/or 9M38M1 type. The number 8 is the manufacturer’s code, namely: the Dolgoprudny Research and Manufacturing Enterprise in Moscow. The number 86 indicates the year of production, namely 1986. And the number 9032 is the unique identification number of this specific missile engine.
The European Union and NATO have called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT’s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are formally holding Russia accountable. The US has supported the decisions by the Netherlands and Australia.",REAL
527,NAME OF THE “IRON WOLF” NATO EXERCISES IN LITHUANIA IS A REFERENCE TO FASCISM AND ADOLF HITLER,"SUMMARY
The “Iron Wolf” was the name of a Lithuanian fascist union, which was established in 1927 under the authoritarian rule of Antanas Smetona. The decision to call the NATO exercises taking place in Lithuania with this name is a provocation – this signal is clearly aimed against Russia.
All allusions concerning the “wolf” are a reference to Adolf Hitler, as his headquarters were called Wolfschanze (Wolf’s Lair).
DISPROOF
This message is a part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it continuously accuses the Baltic states of their support for the Nazi or Fascist ideology. Any disagreement with the official Kremlin’s view on the history of the Baltic states is automatically labelled by Russia as support for “Nazism”.
The Iron Wolf is a mythical character from a medieval legend of the founding of the city of Vilnius. The name of the Iron Wolf holds one of the most important units of the Lithuanian Army - Mechanised Infantry Brigade “Iron Wolf”.
A Lithuanian paramilitary organization “Iron Wolf” (“Geležinis Vilkas”) existed in 1927-1934 – it united mainly young army officers. In 1934, the followers of the “Iron Wolf” tried to implement the coup d'état against President Smetona – the coup failed, and the organization was destroyed by the Lithuanian authorities. Thus, this organization stopped to exist very quickly after Hitler came to power in Germany.
The claim that “any allusions concerning the “wolf” is a reference to Adolf Hitler as his headquarters were called Wolfschanze (Wolf's Lair)” cannot be taken seriously – it is a common word used all over the world without any alleged references to Hitler.
In other words, the name of NATO exercises “Iron Wolf” clearly refers to the well-known legend about the Iron Wolf, a mythical founder of the city of Vilnius (not depending on the grammar form of this name in Lithuanian – “Geležinis Vilkas” or „Geležinio Vilko”).

The West’s geopolitical goal is to destroy the alternative poles of power – Russia and China – because they challenge the unipolar liberal world order, as theorized by Zbignew Brzezinski. The strategy aimed at destroying Russia as an alternative center of world power was theorized by Brzezinski and is now being implemented on a daily basis by the West.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Western liberal world allegedly pursuing a belligerent and hostile agenda against Russia  and China.
Zbigniew Brzezinski, who died in May 2017 at the age of 89, was the U.S. diplomat and political scientist of Polish decent who authored several books and advised American leaders for decades. Zakhar Prilepin, a Russian novelist and a right-wing radical, attributed to Zbigniew Brzezinski the following quote: “The twenty-first century will be built at the expense of Russia, on the ruins of Russia and against Russia.” The quote was used in the context of a claim that NATO, in its “war with Russia,” was following Brzezinski’s precept. Multiple variations of the same quote have been circulating for years throughout the Russian media and repeated by the country’s top newsmakers, including State Duma deputy Natalia Narochinitskaya and Academy Award-winning movie director Nikita Mikhalkov.
In its May 2017 obituary of Brzezinski, the Russian edition of Esquire magazine cited a slightly different version of the same quote, attributing it to Brzezinski’s 1997 book “The Grand Chessboard"":
“Here is what he wrote in his famous book ‘The Great Chessboard"" (published in 1997): ‘The New World Order will be built against Russia, on the ruins of Russia and at the expense of Russia. We destroyed the Soviet Union, we will destroy Russia. You don't stand a chance’.”
After examining Brzezinski’s published works, as well as interviews with people who were close to him, Polygraph.info concludes that the quote is fake. The quote that Esquire attributed to Brzezinski’s “The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives"" in fact, does not appear in the book.

On the 25th of November 2018, border patrol boats belonging to Russia’s FSB security service seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat and their crews after shooting at them, wounding several Ukrainian servicemen and arresting 24 members.
Russia stated they were in Russian waters. However, according to the bilateral agreement between Ukraine and Russia, the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov are the internal waters of both Russia and Ukraine.
The agreement gives both parties the power to inspect suspicious vessels. Furthermore, both the 2003 bilateral agreement and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea provide for freedom of navigation.

Russia was under international pressured to return the ships to Ukraine, including from the EU. At a meeting in Hamburg on 25 May 2019, the United Nations International Court of the Law of the Sea ordered Russia to immediately release 24 captured Ukrainian sailors, as well as return the Berdyansk, Nikopol, and Yany-Kapu warships to Ukraine. The court agreed with the position of Ukraine that the passage of ships through the Kerch Strait in November 2018 was a security operation to patrol the borders.

535,RUSSIA IS A PEACEFUL COUNTRY THAT RETURNED CAPTURED WARSHIPS TO UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
Russia returned Ukrainian warships captured off the coast of Crimea. This was done in order to show that Russia is a peaceful country that is against violence in relations with Ukraine. This is exclusively a gesture of the Kremlin’s goodwill towards Ukraine.

536,ANTI-RUSSIAN OUTLET BELLINGCAT ALMOST CAUSED A WAR BETWEEN GEORGIA AND AZERBAIJAN,"SUMMARY
Another lie from the notorious Western project “Bellingcat”, actively used by Georgian media to disseminate anti-Russian propaganda that pleased its foreign sponsors, almost caused a very real conflict. On November 1, information was circulated that Azerbaijani troops allegedly occupied part of Georgian territory near the junction of the borders of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. Other media picked up the story but without quoting its origin, causing alarm among Georgian citizens. Local media, even after realising that the Bellingcat news was an outright lie, chose to remain silent rather than dissipate fears. The discrediting of this anti-Russian resource was more unacceptable for them than alleviating panic.
DISPROOF
No evidence is provided to prove that Bellingcat's original report caused any escalation between Georgia and Azerbaijan beyond already existing tensions.
This is part of a recurrent Russian effort to discredit the highly respected investigative site Bellingcat, which uncovered many elements in cases such as the downing of the MH17 flight or the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergey Skripal that contradict and expose Russian disinformation narratives. In our database, you can find other examples of false accusations against Bellingcat, such as it being anti-Russian, its instrumentalisation by governments to contradict proof of Russia's innocence or its alleged fabrication of evidence against Moscow.",REAL
537,WASHINGTON IS LIKELY TO LAUNCH A WAR AGAINST RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
There are two scenarios of the US launching war against Russia. The first envisages a US military attack using all available means, including nuclear weapons. The second scenario envisages Russia’s economic isolation in order to induce a “change of political leadership”. The likelihood of combat action is quite real, as Washington may urgently need a “fairly large war”.
DISPROOF
This claim involves speculation without evidence. It is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Russophobia, US/NATO military aggression towards Russia, and alleged US funding of ""colour revolutions"" in Russia and other post-Soviet states. It also plays into the oft-used narrative that the West wants to conquer and subdue Russia, in order to portray Russia as the victim of unjustified aggression against which it must defend itself.

538,WASHINGTON IS USING NATO FOR MILITARY CONFRONTATION IN THE ARCTIC,"SUMMARY
The military-industrial complex in Washington is determined to extract as much cash as possible from the Arctic, and the planned peaceful development of the region by Russia is a disturbing complication. Washington is using NATO as a front to establish an Arctic Circle of military confrontation in the hope that this will prevent Russia from exploring the region for oil and gas and extracting the resources known to be there.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the US, claiming - on the basis of no evidence - that American and NATO policies are a threat to world peace and security.
US policy towards the Arctic emphasises science and international collaboration, tending to neglect strategic and geopolitical considerations.
In June 2019, the US Department of Defense released its updated Arctic Defence Strategy. This document focuses on threats posed by Russia – which is building up and upgrading military infrastructure in its Arctic region – and by China. Previously abandoned Cold War-era military installations have been reopened and incursions by Russian aircraft and submarines into or close to other countries’ Arctic spaces have become more frequent. However, contrary to the claim made in this story, US experts argue that the Arctic Defence Strategy does not commit the necessary resources to address these challenges, nor does it provide clear policy recommendations.
The US and NATO are reviewing their policies in the Arctic region because of the increasing military activities of Russia and in China in the Arctic.",REAL

561,Fake: Ukraine has agreed with Russia's position on the Donbas,"Immediately after the interview, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Vadim Pristayko for the BBC Ukrainian service there are many fakes and manipulation: the Ukrainian leadership has recognized that it can abandon the Minsk agreements and allegedly stated that ""may adopt"" offers Russian President Vladimir Putin on possible alternatives for resolving the situation in the Donbass. Such measures could be the introduction of world mission on the contact line with the ""People's Republic"" - and in the opinion of agitprop such variant ""suggested earlier, Putin"" and the official Kiev allegedly at the moment ""is ready to consider"" the proposal and the proposal of the Kremlin control abroad. Articles of propaganda, based on an interview with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Pristayko were taken out selectively quotes from the text and supplemented by speculation and manipulation. The main focus interview Pristayko was really aimed at solving the conflict in the Donbass region, the minister said that Ukraine can offer to the Kremlin withdrew its troops from the occupied territories and cease support for militant groups from the so-called ""LDNR"". Pristayko did say that Ukraine may withdraw from the Minsk Agreement, but not due to the fact that ""refuses"" to fulfill them and to find new ways to end the war. The Minister stressed that such a decision would be very unpopular among the European partners of Kiev.
Pristayko also confirmed that one of these options could be the establishment of a peacekeeping mission in the Donbass. This idea is not really new, but it did not belong to the Russian President Putin - the first to propose the introduction of peacekeepers in the occupied territories of the fifth head of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, another in 2015. Ukraine four years insisted that the mission's mandate should be extended to the entire occupied territory Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The Kremlin claims that is supposedly not a party to the conflict and the claims that peacekeepers should be placed on the line of contact with the ""LDNR"" (read more about the peacekeepers in this StopFake material). Ukrainian authorities do not agree with this position, although agitprop and writes otherwise.
""Kiev has a vision of a few options. For example, if Minsk does not, we then need to apply for a peacekeeping mission, rather peacekeeping - peacekeeping mission ... While these conversations are carried out since 2015, but so far Russia as a member of the UN Security Council did not allow such a mission. Moreover, they made their option - you remember - to place peacekeepers along the contact line. We do not like it. But a compromise - for example, the peacekeepers on the line between Ukraine and Russia - we would have made "", - said Pristayko. Ukraine did not agree on another Kremlin proposal to control the border. In this regard, the Kremlin also requires placement of forces is not on the Russian-Ukrainian border, and on the line of contact. Ukraine adheres to that same point of view: first, the transfer of control of Kiev for the site and then the local elections. The only concession that could go Kiev says Pristayko - this accommodation on the border not only Ukrainian military forces, but also the OSCE observers.
""Do not confuse the Ukrainian border control and control of the border. It was possible in the course of negotiations to enter the formula, when the control takes place abroad together, for example, Ukraine and the OSCE. One idea was to extend the mission for all 400 km of the border due to technical equipment, drones, cameras. This is not what we want, because we want our APU, the guards came out, but this is the first step to someone other than the Russians controlled the border "", - said Pristayko.
Pristayko also stressed that Ukraine is ready for a meeting in the Norman format and expects to negotiate clear proposals from the Russian leadership. Ukrainian diplomat stressed that all parties in September approved a draft communiqué to be adopted on the basis of a future meeting. The document spelled out, including the requirement to open for humanitarian international organizations access to the occupied territories. Pristayko added that Ukraine has fulfilled all the requirements for meeting the four, however, Russia has deliberately delaying the process. ""We look forward to clear the conversation: what you really want from us, moreover, that we have ceased to exist as an independent state - that we can not give way"" - summed up Pristayko.

562,Fake: Ukraine has agreed with Russia's position on the Donbas,"Immediately after the interview, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Vadim Pristayko for the BBC Ukrainian service there are many fakes and manipulation: the Ukrainian leadership has recognized that it can abandon the Minsk agreements and allegedly stated that ""may adopt"" offers Russian President Vladimir Putin on possible alternatives for resolving the situation in the Donbass. Such measures could be the introduction of world mission on the contact line with the ""People's Republic"" - and in the opinion of agitprop such variant ""suggested earlier, Putin"" and the official Kiev allegedly at the moment ""is ready to consider"" the proposal and the proposal of the Kremlin control abroad. Articles of propaganda, based on an interview with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Pristayko were taken out selectively quotes from the text and supplemented by speculation and manipulation. The main focus interview Pristayko was really aimed at solving the conflict in the Donbass region, the minister said that Ukraine can offer to the Kremlin withdrew its troops from the occupied territories and cease support for militant groups from the so-called ""LDNR"". Pristayko did say that Ukraine may withdraw from the Minsk Agreement, but not due to the fact that ""refuses"" to fulfill them and to find new ways to end the war. The Minister stressed that such a decision would be very unpopular among the European partners of Kiev.
Pristayko also confirmed that one of these options could be the establishment of a peacekeeping mission in the Donbass. This idea is not really new, but it did not belong to the Russian President Putin - the first to propose the introduction of peacekeepers in the occupied territories of the fifth head of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, another in 2015. Ukraine four years insisted that the mission's mandate should be extended to the entire occupied territory Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The Kremlin claims that is supposedly not a party to the conflict and the claims that peacekeepers should be placed on the line of contact with the ""LDNR"" (read more about the peacekeepers in this StopFake material). Ukrainian authorities do not agree with this position, although agitprop and writes otherwise.
""Kiev has a vision of a few options. For example, if Minsk does not, we then need to apply for a peacekeeping mission, rather peacekeeping - peacekeeping mission ... While these conversations are carried out since 2015, but so far Russia as a member of the UN Security Council did not allow such a mission. Moreover, they made their option - you remember - to place peacekeepers along the contact line. We do not like it. But a compromise - for example, the peacekeepers on the line between Ukraine and Russia - we would have made "", - said Pristayko. Ukraine did not agree on another Kremlin proposal to control the border. In this regard, the Kremlin also requires placement of forces is not on the Russian-Ukrainian border, and on the line of contact. Ukraine adheres to that same point of view: first, the transfer of control of Kiev for the site and then the local elections. The only concession that could go Kiev says Pristayko - this accommodation on the border not only Ukrainian military forces, but also the OSCE observers.
""Do not confuse the Ukrainian border control and control of the border. It was possible in the course of negotiations to enter the formula, when the control takes place abroad together, for example, Ukraine and the OSCE. One idea was to extend the mission for all 400 km of the border due to technical equipment, drones, cameras. This is not what we want, because we want our APU, the guards came out, but this is the first step to someone other than the Russians controlled the border "", - said Pristayko.
Pristayko also stressed that Ukraine is ready for a meeting in the Norman format and expects to negotiate clear proposals from the Russian leadership. Ukrainian diplomat stressed that all parties in September approved a draft communiqué to be adopted on the basis of a future meeting. The document spelled out, including the requirement to open for humanitarian international organizations access to the occupied territories. Pristayko added that Ukraine has fulfilled all the requirements for meeting the four, however, Russia has deliberately delaying the process. ""We look forward to clear the conversation: what you really want from us, moreover, that we have ceased to exist as an independent state - that we can not give way"" - summed up Pristayko. Thus, Ukraine is really ready to negotiate, but not in any way ""supports Russia"" in regard to the finalization of the conflict in Donbas.",REAL

569,"Fake: Crimean Tatars called the claim of discrimination on the part of Russia ""far-fetched""","UN International Court of Justice ordered Russia to provide counter-terrorist financing in the case of eastern Ukraine and racial discrimination in the Crimea. In Russia reacted to this by spreading information that Crimean Tatars reportedly called Ukraine claims of discrimination in the Russian Federation ""far-fetched"". Immediately after the court decision, the Russian media have decided to mostly ignore the news. Online edition published some news, but on channels, particularly in the outreach program ""An Evening with Vladimir Solovyov"" and ""Time will tell"", which are so fond of discussing the events in Ukraine, and does not decide to recall the decision of the International Court of Justice.
The head of the so-called regional national-cultural autonomy of the Crimean Tatars in the occupied Crimea Eyvaz Umer said the lawsuit Kyiv sued in The Hague, is unfounded: ""Hundreds of thousands of Muslims, Crimean Tatars today learn the language, celebrate their own religious and cultural holidays, praying in mosques, and no one was pursuing. "" He added that in the Crimea there is no persecution on ethnic grounds, and only ""offenders fall into the sphere of justice."" This statement is published by RIA Novosti, MK.ru, RIA Novosti, Izvestiya, 360tv and others. In addition, the publication MK.ru pay attention to the fact that the ""banned in Russia as extremist and terrorist organization"" Majlis ""and"" Hizb ut-Tahrir ""operate freely in Ukraine. They participated in the blockade of the Crimea, undermining the power lines and act against the population of the peninsula. ""
The lawsuit Ukraine against Russia to the International Court in The Hague said that the Russian authorities have harassed the Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea annexed, thus violating the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Ukrainian side, among other things calls: the ban the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, confining the formation of the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar languages, media freedom restrictions in the Crimea, disappearances, assassinations, raids and detention of the Crimean Tatars, the distortion of history in the new Russian textbooks (Crimean Tatar children learn history, which glorified Stalin and the deportation of the Crimean Tatars is not condemned). November 8, 2019 International Court of Justice in The Hague declared its jurisdiction in the case ""against Ukraine of Russia"", and it means that he considers the accusations made by Ukraine, justified. Ahead - a hearing on the merits.
In 2016, the Russian authorities have banned the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people. Then the so-called occupied Crimean Prosecutor Natalia Poklonskaya Majlis called ""puppets in the hands of large Western puppeteers."" With regard to the previously mentioned organization ""Hizb ut-Tahrir"" - it was banned in 2003. Now occupied Crimea continuing persecution of members of the organization. Defenders arrested and convicted in the ""case of Hizb ut-Tahrir"" Crimean people consider them to be motivated persecution on religious grounds.
About the persecution of the Crimean Tatars say not only the Ukrainian authorities, but also independent public human rights organizations. The Crimean Tatar resource center, which monitors the facts of human rights violations, claiming that the increase of repression observed during 2019 in respect of certain groups of the Crimean Tatar activists. With regard to persecution on religious grounds there is a stable tendency to high.

But the rating as such in this study is not, the survey was conducted in 14 European countries and shows the picture only in each of them separately.

In the same vein, the news was picked up by a number of Russian media outlets, such as Lenta.ru, Ukraina.ru, IA ""Rex"", Sight and others. The organization ""Anti-Defamation League"" (ADL) examines attitudes toward Jews, support the stereotypes that still ran the Nazis in various countries around the world. The organization has also index of anti-Semitism, which is using a variety of questions shows the situation with anti-Semitism in the level of a particular country. Among the questions that they ask for this index, there are for example, is: Do you agree with the statement that ""Jews have too much power in international financial markets,"" or that ""Jews have too much control over the US government,"" and so on. d.

Study after 2018 Kantor Center at Tel Aviv University, notes that ""countries with the largest number of cases of violence - USA (over 100 cases), the UK (68), France and Germany (35), Canada (20), Belgium (19 ), the Netherlands (15) and Argentina (11). "" Also, the study write: ""It should be noted that the number of cases in Eastern Europe has been much lower in recent years, in comparison with Western Europe, starting with 12 cases in Ukraine and less in other countries.""
Chief Rabbi of Ukraine Moshe Reuven Azman in an interview with Radio Liberty, said that anti-Semitism in Ukraine is at a low level, lower than in Western Europe. He also noted in April 2019, in the first round of presidential elections in Ukraine the highest number of votes scored Vladimir Zelensky, who has Jewish roots. In addition, the Jew was the previous Prime Minister Vladimir Groisman.
Their opinion on the published in the Ukrainian news media expressed and Head of the Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities of Ukraine Joseph Zissels.

585,NATO IS LIKE A “ZOMBIE” THAT EATS ITS MEMBER STATES,"SUMMARY
Obsolete, superfluous, sounds downright cute. It’s as if the NATO states only had to stop paying and then leave the alliance cheerfully and without any obligation. But already on the way to the alleged end of NATO, the zombie eats the people alive: the undead demands two percent of the gross domestic product so that he can continue to threaten the world. In Germany alone, that would be 60 billion euros. That eats schools, roads, hospitals and ultimately the patients themselves. NATO is the highest expression of dying capitalism, a system that makes its profits from war and the threat of war. A system that eats up its states alive. A system that risks the atomic destruction of the earth to cement its own rule until the end of the capitalist horror film.
DISPROOF
This disinformation message is aimed at undermining the image of NATO, trying to portray NATO as a totalitarian dysfunctional military alliance that oppresses and humiliates its member states. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on member states' subordination to NATO and NATO's belligerent agenda.
When it comes to NATO's decisions, they are made by consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries. Indeed, NATO respects the right of every country to choose its own security arrangements. In fact, Article 13 of the Washington Treaty specifically gives Allies the right to leave. Over the past 65 years, 29 countries have chosen freely, and in accordance with their domestic democratic processes, to join NATO. Not one has asked to leave. This is their sovereign choice.
Germany's defence minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer plans to increase military spending to the NATO target of 2% of gross domestic product.
NATO is an intergovernmental organisation that is funded by its member countries, including Germany. Member countries make direct and indirect contributions to the costs of running NATO and implementing its policies and activities to guarantee their common security strategy.
Also, NATO is a defensive alliance, whose purpose is to protect its' member states.

586,THE CONCEPT OF “ENERGY SECURITY” HAS TURNED INTO AN ANTI-RUSSIAN PROJECT,"SUMMARY
Poland and the United States have put considerable effort into promoting the idea that the Nord Stream 2 challenges EU security. For this purpose, the concept of “energy security” was established. Initially, this concept implied diversification of energy sources, but gradually, it has turned into a clear anti-Russian project. There has been a return to a “Cold War” approach, which assumed that it is not necessary to buy anything from Russia at all. This approach does not imply a diversification of energy sources (purchase of oil and gas from Russia and other suppliers), but on the contrary – to break contacts with Russia and search for other suppliers of energy sources.
DISPROOF
This case is part of the Kremlin's disinformation campaign about European energy policy and the US fight with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
The European Energy Security Strategy is not aimed against Russia or any other supplier of energy sources. Thus, it does not include the complete rupture of energy cooperation with the Russian Federation. The EU Energy Security Strategy was released in May 2014 – it aims to ensure a stable and abundant supply of energy for European citizens and the economy. Regarding its long-term measures, it proposes actions based on eight key pillars, like protecting strategic infrastructure, moderating energy demand, building a well-functioning and fully integrated internal market, increasing energy production in the European Union, diversifying external supplies and related infrastructure and further developing energy technologies.
In other words, the EU Energy Security Strategy is a comprehensive document, which suggests numerous changes to the EU's energy policy, including the diversification of energy sources.
In the case of Poland, in 2015, it completed the construction of the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście, which enabled the import of the LNG from the United States and Qatar. The functioning of this LNG terminal has resulted in a visible reduction of the share of the Russian gas in total Polish consumption - 67% in 2018  and 58% - throughout the first three quarters of 2019. Currently, the regasification capacity of the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście is being expanded from 5 to 7.5 billion cubic meters per year. In addition, Poland is involved in the launch of the Baltic Pipe Project, which will enable access to Norway’s gas fields. In this way, the Russian Gazprom loses its monopoly in Poland, as it will have to compete with alternative gas suppliers.

587,"THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF UKRAINE FEARS 15,000 NEO-NAZIS","SUMMARY
In addition to the SBU, there is this machine of informal terror (neo-Nazis) in Ukraine. They have a salary. They all have official documents. They have the opportunity to get weapons, training, field camps, etc. Without this machine of terror, power will simply be replaced by a popular uprising. These 15,000 people keep the entire population of Ukraine in fear.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given. This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Nazis and fascism in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government does not employ a neo-Nazi ""machine of terror"".
The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy.
Far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. The ""Right Sector"" candidates received 0.7% of the vote in the May 2014 presidential elections, and the party received 1.8% of the vote in the October 2014 parliamentary elections. In 2019 election cycle far-right candidates fell short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.

588,WASHINGTON NEEDED “FIRE IN CENTRAL EUROPE”,"SUMMARY
The United States supplied arms to the new regime in Ukraine after the 2014 coup in Kyiv because it was in need of a fire in Central Europe. The Ukrainian regime set the needed fire by launching the war on the people of the Donbas region who rebelled against the Kyiv coup.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given. This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative painting the 2013-14 protests in Kyiv as a coup orchestrated by the West. It's also a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative undermining the statehood of Ukraine. The message also propagates disinformation about US relations with Ukraine.
Ukraine is recognised by international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The EU and the US support the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter’s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.
The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014. There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine. The EU condemns the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.

589,US SELLS USELESS AND DEFECTIVE ARMS TO ITS PARTNERS,"SUMMARY
The United States sells off obsolete patrol boats to its partners. For instance, Island class patrol boats given to Ukraine, are defective and useless. The cost for these useless boats for the Ukrainian budget was 10 million USD, 5 for each.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on the useless US military technique. Consistent with the narrative that the Western support to Ukraine or Georgia is only a facade.
Island class boats are modern patrol boats, which replaced Cape and Point class patrol boats and are successfully operating under the U.S. Coast Guard. Island class cutters are equipped with advanced electronics and navigation equipment.
Within the framework of the EDA program, the United States handed over several 110-foot Island class patrol boats to the Navies of its partner countries, including Georgia and Ukraine. In fact, Ukraine agreed to take delivery of two U.S. Island class patrol boats as free military aid from the United States. The US Excess Defense Articles Program states that this type of equipment may be offered ""at reduced or no cost to eligible foreign recipients"".

590,RUSSOPHOBIC UK SPOILED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FOR GOOD,"SUMMARY
Because of the Russophobic attitude of the UK, Russian-British relations represent the most significant conflict in Europe. It is an example of how deep-rooted prejudices can spoil relations between the two countries for good.
British Russophobia has gone so far as to accuse Russia of interfering with the referendum where the UK citizens decided to leave the EU.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative linking the UK and Russophobia with no evidence provided. Russophobia is often used in pro-Kremlin disinformation as an explanation for anyone blaming Russia for anything.
By accusing Western societies of “Russophobia”, pro-Kremlin propaganda outlets downgrade criticism of Kremlin policies and actions to being somehow irrational and not worthy of a serious reply. Read previous disinformation message stating that Russophobia is an integral part of British foreign policy.

","SUMMARY
What does James Le Mesurier’s history have to do with the humanitarian work that is supposed to be the work of the “White Helmets”? Everyone knows that they are part of Al-Qaeda for sure. These people, along with bin Laden’s death, with Baghdadi’s recent killing, all these people are killed because they, first of all, hold important secrets, they have become a burden and their role is over.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given. This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the White Helmets, a humanitarian organisation of volunteer rescue workers also known as the Syria Civil Defense, and their recently deceased founder James Le Mesurier. The White Helmets have documented some of the worst atrocities carried out by the Syrian government and the Russian military, and as a result, Russian and Syrian media have consistently sought to delegitimise them through portrayals as a Western-backed “terrorist organisation"".
No evidence is given to substantiate the claim that Le Mesurier has connections to Al Quaeda and/or other terrorist groups. This case, as well as the insinuation that the White Helmets were involved in producing fake evidence of chemical weapons attacks in Syria, are a continuation of smear campaigns against civilian rescuers in Syria that have been circulating in pro-Kremlin media for years.

However, there was no response. Georgia acts with the connivance of its Western partners.
DISPROOF
This message is a part of a larger pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign against the EU's monitoring mission in Georgia (EUMM), which aims to undermine the international credibility of the mission by questioning its impartiality.
EUMM is an unarmed civilian monitoring mission of the European Union, deployed in September 2008 following the EU-mediated Six Point Agreement which ended the August war. The EUMM has been patrolling areas adjacent to the Administrative Boundary Lines with Abkhazia and South Ossetia day and night ever since, to ensure that there is no return to hostilities and to facilitate resumption of normal life for communities on the both sides of  Administrative Boundary Lines.

The goal of the “Tsnelisi provocation” is to destroy the concept of South Ossetia’s border. A massive information attack orchestrated by Georgia, the EU and the USA against South Ossetia is another attempt by Tbilisi, Brussels and Washington to question the political consequences of the war in August 2008. Supported by its Western partners, Georgia is refusing to accept the consequences of its provocative actions. The country is refusing to sign a document on the non-use of force and is preparing its forces for a military conflict. The aim of South Ossetia is to put an end to Tbilisi’s aggression even by joining the Russian Federation.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative targeting the EU's monitoring mission in Georgia (EUMM), aiming to undermine its international credibility.
The Tsnelisi  incident took place on October 24 when the EUMM monitors had been detained by South Ossetian security actors. The EU Monitoring Mission released a statement noting that the incident ""happened in an area understood to be on Tbilisi-Administered Territory in accordance with the traditional interpretation of the Administrative Boundary Line in that area.""  See previous disinformation case accusing EU observers of border violation and provocation.
In 2010 Georgia signed a unilateral declaration on the non-use of force and demanded the same from Russia as Georgia considers Russia as a conflict party. Russia refuses to sign a bilateral agreement and demands Georgia to sign the declaration on the non-use of force with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

596,CREATION OF NATO WAS NOT JUSTIFIED,"SUMMARY
Macron thinks that NATO was conceived as a response to the enemy, as a response to the Warsaw Pact. The situation is actually exactly the opposite. NATO’s birthday is 4 April 1949. This means that less than four years after the World War II ended, former Allies of the USSR in the fight against fascism have created against the USSR a military bloc, where apart from the US entered France, the UK, Canada, Benelux countries, Italy, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Portugal. And only six years later, in response to this, Warsaw Pact was formed on 14 May 1955, as a counterweight to NATO. Apart from the USSR, the Pact included Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.
So, when Macron says that NATO was thought as a “response to the enemy”, it is actually exactly the opposite: it was thought as a threat to a friend, with whom they fought against fascism and with whom they were setting up post-war life in Europe. And if so, then the creation of NATO was not justified at all.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative involving historical revisionism.
Right after the Second World War, Soviet troops occupied a number of countries in Central Europe. In accordance with the agreements between the Allies, these countries were given the freedom to choose their political orientation. Bulgaria and Romania were supposed to keep the monarchy. In the elections in Hungary, the non-communist party led by Zoltan Tildy received the absolute majority. The pre-war republic was restored in Czechoslovakia. However, by 1949, all the governments of Central and Eastern Europe, except Yugoslavia, turned into hard-line Stalinist regimes under the influence of the USSR. On top of that, in June 1948 the Soviet Union blocked supply routes to West Berlin causing the Berlin blockade which lasted for almost one year. 
Thus, the conflict between the Allies began almost as soon as the guns fell silent at the end of World War II. It led Western allies to seek ways to prevent further expansion of Communist influence on the European continent. And on 4 April 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty was signed, serving three purposes: deterring Soviet expansionism, forbidding the revival of nationalist militarism in Europe, and encouraging European political integration.

597,FRENCH AUTHORITIES SET UP VIOLENCE AT PEACEFUL YELLOW VESTS’ ANNIVERSARY RALLY,"SUMMARY
The strategy of order enforcement chosen by the prefect of Paris has been highly criticised. He wanted the Yellow Vests’ demonstration to start at Place d’Italie, an area under construction which contains construction equipment, often thrown by the thugs and who, surprisingly, were there since the early morning.
Controversy is also growing over a video clearly showing “two people framing a third man, all dressed in black, who were behind the line of CRS [riot police] who let them pass whilst repeating: ‘This is the BAC, it is the BAC [branch of the criminal police in France]’,” as noted by Liberation’s CheckNews. That led to accusations about police infiltrators within the thugs.
All this was wanted by the government only to destroy the anniversary of Yellow Vests. It’s worse than a fracture. It serves the dictatorship that is being put in place.
DISPROOF
Biased conspiracy theory coverage of the Yellow Vests' one year anniversary protests in Paris. Speaking about the video proving the presence of law enforcers in civilian clothes among protesters (assumed by the French police itself), the article quotes the French newspaper Liberation and its CheckNews service. The video is supposed to ""feed the accusations"" that the police infiltrated the thugs. In reality, Liberation states the contrary, debunking those accusations. This is what Libération actually writes:
""It should be noted that beyond the infiltration of police for intelligence missions and arrests, commentators also accuse police officers of infiltrating the rallies only to organise violence and to help to destroy the image of the movement in public opinion. This is particularly the case of the yellow vest François Boulo, who claims to have seen disguised policemen turning over a car, and he goes to imagine that 'police-thugs' were able to degrade the stele of Marshal Juin. No elements in CheckNews' possession support such accusations.""
No evidence is given to support other claims that the Paris city hall conspired to tarnish the Yellow Vests' anniversary.
It is worth recalling that the Yellow Vests presented their candidates' list for the European Parliament elections in 2019, which would be impossible under a dictatorship.

598,IN NOVEMBER 2018 THREE UKRAINIAN SHIPS VIOLATED RUSSIAN TERRITORIAL WATERS NEAR THE KERCH STRAIT,"SUMMARY
On the 18th of November 2019, Moscow handed over to Ukraine the three ships that in November 2018  were seized by Russian authorities because they violated Russian territorial waters near the Kerch Strait.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the Kerch incident.
On the 25th of November 2018, border patrol boats belonging to Russia’s FSB security service seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat and their crews after shooting at them, wounding several Ukrainian servicemen and arresting 24 members.
Russia stated they were in Russian waters. However, according to the bilateral agreement between Ukraine and Russia, the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov are the internal waters of both Russia and Ukraine. The agreement gives both parties the power to inspect suspicious vessels. Furthermore, both the 2003 bilateral agreement and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea provide for freedom of navigation.
On the 25th May on 2019, the UN International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that Russia should release the sailors detained in the Kerch Strait and return the ships to Ukraine.
Twenty-four military sailors returned to Ukraine on 7 September as part of a mutual release of detainees by Ukraine and Russia. On 18 November 2019, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had handed three naval ships back to Ukraine.

599,UKRAINIAN SHIPS BREACHED RUSSIAN WATERS,"SUMMARY
On 25 November 2018, Russian border guards detained Ukrainian ships after the latter entered Russian territorial waters and penetrated the border in the Kerch Strait.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the Azov Sea and the Kerch incident.
On 25 November 2018, border patrol boats belonging to Russia’s FSB security service seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tugboat and their crews after shooting at them, wounding several Ukrainian servicemen and arresting 24 members.
Russia argued that they were in Russian waters. However, a bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, signed in 2003 and ratified by Russia in 2004, governs the use of the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov, which in the treaty is considered to be the “internal waters” of both Russia and Ukraine.
On 25 May 2019, the United Nations Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ordered Russia to immediately release Ukrainian sailors and allow them to return to Ukraine. The EU urged Russia to release the captured crew.
Twenty-four military sailors returned to Ukraine on 7 September 2019 as part of a mutual release of detainees by Ukraine and Russia. On 21 November 2019, Russia returned the ships to Ukraine.",REAL
600,UKRAINIAN SHIPS VIOLATED NAVAL SAFETY RULES IN 2018 AZOV SEA CONFRONTATION,"SUMMARY
Russia detained three Ukrainian vessels which  attempted to cross the Kerch Strait on 25 November 2018. Both Ukrainian and Russian ships have passage rights, but there are strict safety rules, which Moscow said the Ukrainian Navy had breached.
The conflict stopped short of bloodshed and resulted in the arrests of the Ukrainian sailors and their ships for “violation of territorial waters.”
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on the November 2018 Kerch Strait incident.
The so-called ""safety rules"" referred to in the report are not the internationally recognised standards enshrined in long-standing treaties and customary law, but rather a set of makeshift guidelines which Russia unilaterally adopted in 2015 and Kyiv never recognised, given that the regulations are based on Russia's illegal claim to Crimea. Since then, Russian patrols have routinely carried out arbitrary arrests of Ukrainian and foreign ships, demanding that all vessels give ""advance notice"" of passage through the Kerch area, contrary both to the provisions of the 2003 agreement and to actual navigation safety guidelines.
In a May 2019 ruling concerning the incident, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea rejected Russia's arguments and ordered it to return all three Ukrainian ships and to release all 24 crew members (they were returned to Ukraine on 7 September 2019, as a part of a mutual release of detainees by Ukraine and Russia. On 18 November 2019, Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had handed three naval ships back to Ukraine).
The report falsely claims that the incident ""stopped short of bloodshed."" In fact, Russian security personnel opened fire at the Ukrainian vessels and wounded a number of their crew.",REAL
601,WASHINGTON HAS INTERVENED IN BOLIVIA,"SUMMARY
For the first time, the United States indirectly intervened in the internal political conflict in Bolivia, reaching out to the country’s military and political elite.
The technology of the organisation of the coup, used by the United States in Venezuela and Bolivia, can be applied in Russia. Unlike the classic examples of Ukraine, Georgia and Hong Kong, the trouble in Bolivia, Venezuela is not “colour revolutions” – it is an apostate coup d’etat, organised by agreement with individual elite groups.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given.This narrative falls within the broader pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts attempting to deny the existence of genuine grass-roots protests, portraying them as foreign-led efforts and fake colour revolutions.
This is also part of a disinformation narrative about US-led regime change operations against left-wing governments in Latin America. You can see other examples of this narrative in the database, such as the alleged presence of a US marine in the Venezuelan barricades and the promotion of a Ukraine-style 'colour revolution', the training of Venezuelan exiles in Guyana for military operations inside the country, preparations for a military intervention after forcing Brazil to join NATO, deliberate blackouts in South America caused by the US, or the existence of plans for the secession of oil-rich regions in both Venezuela and Mexico.
Although the United States ""applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom"", there is no evidence to suggest that the US was directly involved in Evo Morales' resignation.
Morales’ resignation came during mass protests in the country after the Organisation of American States (OAS) reported “extensive irregularities” in the election for his fourth term. Morales had invited the OAS to observe the vote, and the group called for the election to be annulled. Read full debunk by Polygraph.

602,THE US CREATES A BELT OF INSTABILITY AROUND THEIR GEOPOLITICAL ADVERSARY – RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
The United States definitely has far-reaching goals in Georgia. They are connected with the intention of creating a belt of instability around Russia, their main geopolitical adversary. Do you need a situation in which thousands of protesters take to the streets? Easily! Therefore, the Americans will continue to do everything possible to “overlay” Russia with zones of instability.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative alleging the undue influence of the US in the post-Soviet space; painting all manifestations of popular discontent in the region as manufactured elsewhere, portraying entire nations as pathologically Russophobic, presenting colour revolutions as attempts by the West to encircle Russia and create instability around all Russian border.
The narrative has been applied, among others, to report about protests in Ukraine, Georgia, and Belarus, as well as to portray the West as an aggressive actor constantly preparing new coups.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the West destroyed the USSR, that the Hong Kong protests are the West’s revenge on China for not waging war against Russia, that the goal of the US global “Anaconda” strategy is to limit the living space of geopolitical opponents, and that the West's objective is to encircle Russia entirely thanks to the ""Anaconda ring"" and ""Great Turan"" doctrines.",REAL
603,RESIDENTS OF DONBAS WILL BE FORCIBLY RELOCATED TO LVIV FOR RE-EDUCATION,"SUMMARY
After Kyiv gains control of the border, the residents of Donbas will see immediate cleansing, deportation and total Ukrainisation. Everything is very simple: you speak Ukrainian – you stay. If you don’t speak Ukrainian – you will get a suitcase, go to a railway station and move to Russia. And this is in the best case. At worst, you will be forced to relocate to Lviv for re-education.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory with no evidence. See similar disinformation messages alleging that Kyiv is sabotaging the peace settlement in Donbas or Ukraine will fight with Donbas and kill its people.
The source of this information was a fake document allegedly from the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine with incorrect details such as the address of the Council or names of the officials. It was spread  in the social media platform ""Telegram"" with the help of an anonymous account. Moreover, the fake document does not contain any information about relocation to Lviv and the re-education of people from Donbas.
At the end of October 2019, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, announced the need for a state strategy for the integration of Donbas and Crimea. According to him, such a strategy should include transparency, consensus, realism, and implementation of decisions. It is planned to discuss all these issues with the public.
Advisor to the Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council on integration and renewal of the Donbas, Serhiy Sivokho, noted that the Council planned to create a National Platform for Reconciliation and Unity. “We attract international practitioners to resolve military conflicts, analyse the experience of Ireland, Bosnia and other countries.

604,NATO IS AMERICAN PROPERTY USED TO JUSTIFY EVERY US INTERVENTION,"SUMMARY
After the end of the Cold War, NATO became US property and a tool, justifying every American intervention. Article 5 is perceived as NATO members’ obligation to America, while the USA has freed itself from any commitments.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation message about NATO as a geopolitical project of the US.
NATO was founded in 1949 by twelve sovereign nations: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States. It has since grown to 29 Allies who each took an individual and sovereign decision to join this Alliance. All decisions in NATO are taken by consensus, which means that a decision can only be taken if every single member accepts it. No member of the Alliance can order the deployment of armed forces of other member states.
Article 5 of the Washington Treaty embodies the principle of collective defense where an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all.

605,ANTI-RUSSIAN HYSTERIA GAVE BIRTH TO DAEMONS SUCH AS FASCISM AND BANDERISM,"SUMMARY
Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, it makes no sense to look for the daemons of the XXth century in Moscow. Anti-Russian hysteria has already given birth to daemons such as the apology of Banderism in Ukraine, fascism in the Baltic states, and the Polish mix of consent towards Banderism, chauvinism, anti-Semitism and “bleaching” of fascism.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative attempting to link the Baltic countries, Ukraine, and Poland with Nazism, Fascism, and anti-Semitism. The accusation of Nazism is a popular propaganda technique used by pro-Kremlin outlets as explained in our following analysis Nazi east, Nazi west, Nazi over the cuckoo's nest.

607,THE EU IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON MOSCOW BECAUSE CRIMEA RETURNED TO RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Following the return of Crimea to Russia in 2014, the European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia, which run until 31 January 2020.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal annexation of Crimea.
Crimea did not ""return"" to Russia but was illegally annexed by Moscow. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and deliberate destabilisation of Ukraine, the EU has progressively imposed restrictive measures against Russia.

608,THE EU WANTS BELARUS TO LOSE ITS INDEPENDENCE,"SUMMARY
Belarusian democratic opposition prevents Belarus’ rapprochement with Europe by insisting on the introduction of EU sanctions. When the Belarusian authorities have a thaw with the EU, the opposition does its best to cast a shadow over it. It also starts organizing protest actions and rallies. They do everything to tarnish the reputation of the country in the field of human rights. Until Belarusian opposition exists, Belarusians will not become a part of the European community.
European politicians are not interested in a better relationship with Belarus either. It seems their plan is to give the Belarusian government hope for it and then to overthrow the authorities by the hands of the opposition. Hence Minsk should not believe any of the EU’s promises. Games with the EU pose a risk of losing independence; this is what numerous EU programs aim to do. [Europe] does not need an independent and integral Belarus, but a poor, easily manipulated anti-Russian country. Integration with Russia is the only right political course and the only way to secure Belarus’ well-being.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory which is consistent with recurring Belarus-related pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about a subservient Belarusian opposition, and Western attempts to organise a colour revolution in Belarus and disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations.
In recent years, relations between the European Union and Belarus have gone through a number of stages. The Belarusian authorities' December 2010 post-election crackdown and their imprisonment of opposition leaders led to a number of restrictive measures being applied by the European Union, as well as a wider policy of critical engagement.
Over the past two years, there has been some positive progress in EU-Belarus relations. Belarus has been participating more proactively in the Eastern Partnership, particularly in the multilateral formats, while negotiations on a Mobility Partnership were concluded and Visa Facilitation and Readmission Agreements are to be launched soon.

609,SOROS IS LINKED TO THE ORANGE REVOLUTION AND REGIME CHANGES IN UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
George Soros involvement in Ukraine is well known, his name is linked to the Orange Revolution and regime changes in this country. Like in Georgia. George Soros himself acknowledged, in an interview with CNN, that he actively contributed to the overthrow of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. “I created a foundation in Ukraine before it became independent from Russia. The foundation has functioned since then and has played an important role in current events,” explains the financier.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory based on recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about George Soros. 
A foundation sponsored by George Soros, the International Renaissance Foundation, as part of the Open Society Foundations, was established in Ukraine in April 1990, following the aim to assist the transition to democracy and a market economy. At that time, the Open Society Foundations’ focused in former Communist states on modernization and reforming of national institutions and support for civil society groups/organizations. The Foundation in Ukraine has many projects in different areas, such as fighting corruption by strengthening transparency and accountability, supporting investigative journalism projects, supporting the creation of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine since 2014 as well as the development of independent media outlets. Since 2014, the foundation has been among the founders of StopFake.org, an initiative dedicated to exposing lies and myths about Ukraine. More about George Soros foundation in Ukraine read here.

According to the latest UN statistics, the number of victims of this conflict has exceeded 13,000.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about war in Ukraine, aiming to portray the conflict as Ukraine's civil war.
The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict, but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine.

We know perfectly well who is behind all the events in Bolivia, who has sought the resignation of Morales – the United States. They have long sought his resignation because naturally, Americans don’t like the left in Latin America.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given. This narrative falls within the broader pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts attempting to deny the existence of genuine grass-roots protests, portraying them as foreign-led efforts and fake colour revolutions.
This is also part of a disinformation narrative about US-led regime change operations against left-wing governments in Latin America.

613,THE US ORGANISED A COUP IN BOLIVIA TO CONTROL LITHIUM DEPOSITS,"SUMMARY
A desperate attempt to seize power by a pro-American minority is driven by cynical rational, experts say. Bolivia possesses the largest lithium deposits in the world. A growing production of batteries and electric cars instigates an increased demand for lithium on the world market. In early November, the Bolivian authorities refused to cooperate with the Germans on lithium extraction. Instead, the Chinese and Russians could be involved in cooperation with Bolivia in this sphere. This is just a business: the US-educated Bolivian military is shooting civilians who protest against the preservation of power by the pro-US government. It is unlikely, however, that the interim government and their US patrons will swallow Bolivia so easily. The county is on the edge of civil war and chaos.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy and no evidence is provided to support the claim. It is an example of a recurrent disinformation narrative about US-led regime change operations against left-wing governments in Latin America.

614,THERE WERE NO AND ARE NO RUSSIAN TROOPS IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
There were and at the moment are no Russian troops in Donbas, but the Russian army has information from the border regions.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, claiming that Russia is not part of the conflict in Donbas, that Russia has nothing to do with the war in eastern Ukraine and that there is a “civil war” in Donbas.
There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The EU condemns the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"".  At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014, NATO leaders condemned in the strongest terms Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine and demanded Russia to stop and withdraw its forces from Ukraine and from the country’s border. NATO leaders also demanded Russia complies with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine.

Poland plays the role of a “banana republic” in its alliance with the United States. This country is allowing the hegemon to take advantage of it, without being forced to.

A common pro-Kremlin narrative on “lost sovereignty” - in the case of Poland, this country is often presented as a “puppet-state” of the United States.
This narrative includes a message that the United States manipulates Poland and other European allies in order to carry out its anti-Russian policies.

617,"THE US ASSURED GORBACHEV THAT NATO WOULD NOT EXPAND EASTWARD
","SUMMARY
In 1990, the president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, was assured by the US government that NATO would not expand to the East.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the West encircling Russia via NATO.
This promise was never made, as Mikhail Gorbachev, then-president of the Soviet Union, has himself confirmed.
Central and Eastern European countries began seeking NATO membership in the early 1990s. NATO actively sought to create a cooperative environment that was conducive to enlargement while simultaneously building special relations with Russia.
NATO does not ""expand"" in the imperialistic sense described by pro-Kremlin media. Rather, it considers the applications of candidate countries who want to join the alliance of their own national will. As such, NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. NATO's ""Open Door Policy"" is based on Article 10 of the Alliance's founding document, the North Atlantic Treaty (1949). The Treaty states that NATO membership is open to any ""European state in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area"". Every sovereign nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security, and one to which Russia has also subscribed.",REAL

DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about US presence in Europe, portraying France as a vassal of the USA. Russian disinformation sources often claim that almost all European countries are no longer truly sovereign and the United States dictate policies to the EU and its member states.
The EU Member States are sovereign countries and make sovereign decisions about their own security and defense policies. The US is an important ally to the EU but EU policy is not determined by the US.",REAL
619,THE USA WILL FULFIL NATO’S ARTICLE 5 ONLY IF IT IS REQUIRED BY ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS,"SUMMARY
The realist theory of international relations dominating the USA assumes that the national interest of the state is superior to the international law and treaties signed with its allies. In other words, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty would be fulfilled by the United States only in a situation, when the US interests agree with its legal obligations.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on NATO and the US military presence in Europe - it claims that the United States may not protect its European allies if it goes against the US national interests.
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is the critical component of the Alliance – it assumes that if a NATO Ally is a victim of an armed attack, every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked. In other words, Article 5 is the cornerstone of NATO – it has been invoked only once in history as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The United States is the founding member of NATO and plays a crucial role in European and transatlantic security – since the end of WWII, the US troops based in Europe guaranteed the security of its European allies. Currently, the US is increasing its military presence in Europe (particularly in Central and Eastern Europe) in order to protect this region against two primary threats: Russia's ""malign influence"" and international terrorism.

620,WHISTLEBLOWER WHO TRIGGERED THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY LINKED TO GEORGE SOROS,"SUMMARY
The impeachment process is the latest scenario in the fight to death between Donald Trump and globalist megaspeculator George Soros, who has been linked to the identity of the anonymous whistleblower of Ukrainegate, the plot that replaces the fake Russiagate. Soros aims to behead Trump, who has angered the Deep State, by promoting  impeachment and preventing his reelection with a clear geopolitical goal: stopping the rapprochement between the US and Russia.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. No proof is provided to support the claims.
Though billionaire investor George Soros has been vocal in his opposition to Donald Trump, there is zero evidence of any link between him and the anonymous whistle-blower whose denunciation unleashed the impeachment inquiry. The investigation started because of concerns from senior US diplomats that President Trump was abusing his power to pressurise a foreign government to investigate a political rival, not by a Soros-led Deep State attempt to prevent a rapprochement between the US and Russia.
This story mixes two recurrent Russian disinformation narratives, the first about an alleged Deep State that controls US politics above elected representatives, and a second portraying George Soros as the driving force behind almost every problem, unrest or controversial issue in the world.
You can see many other examples of disinformation about George Soros in our database, such as his alleged promotion of protests in Mexico, Catalonia, Romania, Russia, Armenia or Czech Republic (among many other places), his destabilising manoeuvres all over the world, his sponsorship of the film “Joker” as a tutorial for future ‘colour revolutions’, his attempts to destabilise Europe (mainly through the promotion of massive immigration) or his adoption of the term “conspiracy theory” to discredit those who speak the truth.",REAL
621,THE GREEK CHURCH RECOGNISED UKRAINIAN AUTOCEPHALY UNDER PRESSURE,"SUMMARY
Constantinople, as you know, threatened to take control over some of the dioceses from the Church of Greece if the latter does not recognise the schismatic Orthodox Church of Ukraine. It is also well-known, and Greek sources confirm, that the US Embassy in Athens also exerted unprecedented pressure on the Archbishop of Athens.
DISPROOF
A conspiracy theory presented without any supporting evidence and recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
The process of recognition was initiated by the Orthodox Church of Greece on 8 January 2019, when the Permanent Synod of the Church of Greece decided that the issue of recognition would be dealt with by the Synod of the Hierarchy of the Church of Greece.
In February, the Synod of the Church decided to appoint two commissions to study the issue. In August, the commissions presented a report and recommended to recognise the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.
On 12 October, the primate of the church Ieronymos II of Athens and other leaders supported the conclusions and voted for the recognition, stating that “the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has the right to grant autocephaly”.

Anton Shekhovstov, who like Grozev also built his career on the use of defamation, has publicised his books through Buzzfeed.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at discrediting serious journalists and scholars that engage in research on pro-Kremlin disinformation and propaganda, by claiming they are Russophobic and spread false information.
The article, which seeks to discredit serious researchers such as Christo Grozev, Anton Shekhovtsov, and Andreas Umland, also implies that “Russophobic” researchers are linked to the Hungarian-American investor and philanthropist George Soros. This claim is consistent with pro-Kremlin conspiracy theories about Soros.
The partnership between the American University in Bulgaria and the Open Society Institute dates back to 1992. The aims of the Open Society Scholarship Programmes are to promote critical thinking, free and open intellectual inquiry, and cross-cultural tolerance and respect, NOT to spread anti-Russian disinformation.
No evidence is provided that Grozev has spread false information. On the contrary, Grozev is a qualified investigative journalist and has done serious research on the Skripal case, the downing of flight MH17, and the planned coup in Montenegro in 2016. The information that Donetsk separatists received instructions to falsify the referendum, which the article claims is false, is actually true. For Grozev’s investigation on this issue see here.
Similar cases can be read here claiming that Buzzfeed and Bellingcat deliberately spread anti-Russian disinformation.

623,KYIV FAVOURS THOSE WHO SUPPORT NAZI VIEWS,"SUMMARY
What is the new Ukrainian government? It is a government that found the people who tore down right-wing monuments but did not find those who vandalised the monument to the victims of the House of Trade Unions in Odessa. And they don’t even bother looking for them. What is the problem? The Ukrainian government puts people who support Nazi views, those who desecrate monuments, higher than those who defend this memory.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about Nazis and fascism in Ukraine.
The myth of Nazi-ruled Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy.
Far-right groups enjoyed a very limited presence during the Euromaidan itself and had poor results in the 2014 presidential and parliamentary elections. The ""Right Sector"" candidate received 0.7% of the vote in the May 2014 presidential elections and the party received 1.8% of the vote in the October 2014 parliamentary elections. In the 2019 election cycle far-right candidates fell short of the 5% minimum guaranteeing entry into parliament.

624,THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMME IS DIRECTED AGAINST RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
The European Union uses the Eastern Partnership Programme to tear the post-Soviet countries from Russia. Under the brand of economic integration and development of EU economic contacts with the Eastern Partners, political and military expansion is taking place. 
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the EU Eastern Partnership. 
The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is a joint policy initiative which aims to deepen and strengthen relations between the European Union (EU), its Member States and its six Eastern neighbours: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The Eastern Partnership initiative is a mutually beneficial and constructive platform for countries in the region to build a closer relationship with the EU if they choose to do so. The EU does not demand any of its partners to make a choice between the EU or any other country. The Eastern Partnership stands for good neighbourly relations and respects the individual aspirations and ambitions of each partner country.

625,THE US PLANS TO TAKE OVER KALINIGRAD REGION,"SUMMARY
The US plans for war against Russia are voiced more and more. Dr. Richard Hooker, senior researcher at the Jamestown Foundation (USA), recently talked about a plan to invade Kaliningrad, while the American publication Foreign Policy reports that Washington will “protect itself from Russia” by horizontal escalation, that is, by attacking the Russian contingent in Syria […]. DISPROOF
This is recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about Western aggression against Kaliningrad.
The origins of this NATO scenario comes from a recent report by the American Jamestown Foundation entitled “How to Defend the Baltic States”, published in October 2019. The report mentions that “three Baltic States—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—face powerful Russian forces” and therefore this report comes to “lay out the military units and force posture, along with changes to Alliance command and control, that would be needed to prevail in case Russia was to spark hostilities in the Baltic States”, after it was proven that ""Russian aggression in Chechnya, Georgia, Donbas, Crimea and Syria have proven that military force can be used successfully without eliciting a forceful response from the West"". As for the publication in Foreign Policy, the article describes the theories of “offshore balancing” or “offshore control”, stating that ""in the event Russia seized the Baltic states, the United States could strike at Russian forces in Crimea or Syria"". 
In addition, during the Warsaw summit in July 2016, NATO has made it clear that ""The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia"".",REAL
626,"IN 2018, UKRAINIAN SHIPS DELIBERATELY VIOLATED RUSSIAN BORDER IN THE KERCH STRAIT
","SUMMARY
[In 2018] three ships, Nikopol, Berdyansk and Yany-Kapu, deliberately violated the borders of the Russian Federation in the area of the Kerch Strait.
DISPROOF
This is a part of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation on the Kerch incident.
On 25 November 2018, border patrol boats belonging to Russia’s FSB security service seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tugboat and their crews after shooting at them, wounding several Ukrainian servicemen and arresting 24 members.
Russia argued that they were in Russian waters. However, a bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, signed in 2003 and ratified by Russia in 2004, governs the use of the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov, which in the treaty is considered to be the “internal waters” of both Russia and Ukraine.
On 25 May 2019, the United Nations Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ordered Russia to immediately release Ukrainian sailors and allow them to return to Ukraine. The EU urged Russia to release the captured crew.
Twenty-four military sailors returned to Ukraine on 7 September 2019 as part of a mutual release of detainees by Ukraine and Russia. On 21 November 2019, Russia returned the ships to Ukraine",REAL
627,"AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL IS AN IDEOLOGICAL TOOL OF THE US SECURITY SERVICES
","SUMMARY
Amnesty International’s report claims Google and Facebook’s business models are a threat to human rights. The organisation has always been an ideological tool of the US security services and a US soft power, just as Greenpeace, WWF, and other human rights and ecological NGOs. Hence, Amnesty International’s report is a position of the US’s establishment and part of the US’s political war against Facebook. The US has, for a long time, effectively controlled central media, which promote LGBT, global warming, Greta Thunberg, inflow of migrants to Europe, so called chemical attacks in Syria, Russian hackers, Hillary Clinton, protests in Hong-Kong, harassment of Harvey Weinstein, and anything else which is necessary for the political agenda. Yet the Western world, and the US as its flagship, are concerned with uncontrolled freedom of speech on social media, including for their ideological opponents – be it Russians, Turks, North Koreans, or Venezuelans. Against the background of increasing erosion of ‘soft power’ and collapse of liberal ideology the West starts to introduce rather strict censorship to protect its ideological machine. Given that you cannot name censorship using its own words, various euphemisms are used instead, fake news in the first place. The Western media are themselves the main producers of fakes, lies are a part of their metabolism. Fake news is just a label to tag everything that does not suit a certain ideological model. Under the pretext of fighting fake news and Russian hackers, the West introduces censorship and open manual controls over the media sphere. Earlier, an instrument of pressure on Facebook and other corporations was the alleged meddling of Russians in the US elections and fake news. Now, Amnesty International’s report puts forward “information manipulation” and “abuse of privacy” as new buzz words and a pretext for attacking Facebook and Google.
DISPROOF
This conspiracy theory is consistent with a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about Western media outlets and NGOs as subservient to Western political elites, while Russia protects freedom of speech and the press. In addition, it represents a continuation of the pro-Kremlin disinformation strategy to undermine and delegitimise civil society initiatives and the work of NGOs.
Western media are not controlled by the government and do not run coordinated (dis)information campaigns on government orders, as this case alleges. A high degree of media freedom in Western countries is reflected in the top ranks these countries occupy in respective world rankings including the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters without Borders. According to the 2019 World Press Freedom Index, Russia is in 149th place out of 180 countries. There is extensive evidence documenting the Kremlin's efforts to use disinformation as a weapon. Russia's attempts at interfering in democratic processes in the US and Europe have been thoroughly documented.
In its new report, Amnesty International indeed says that Facebook and Google’s omnipresent surveillance of billions of people poses a systemic threat to human rights. However, there is zero evidence that Amnesty International, one of the most professional and highly regarded NGOs in the world that is devoted to protecting human rights, is guided by the US governing elite or the security services.
Read our earlier analysis, Russian election meddling and pro-Kremlin disinformation, and previous disinformation cases claiming that Amnesty International is a missionary for the CIA and US State Department, that journalism is free in Russia, and that Western media have a list of individuals and organisations to target with defamatory campaigns.",REAL
628,THE EU WANTS TO DESTROY THE LINK BETWEEN RUSSIA AND BELARUS,"SUMMARY
The decision by Sweden’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to drop the term “Vitryssland” in exchange for “Belarus” demonstrates that the EU bureaucracy and affiliated global elites seek to put Belarus on Ukraine’s track. To achieve this goal, they need to set conditions for geopolitical aggression in the region. One of the current goals is to cut off the associative link between Russia and Belarus (the White Russia) in the public media sphere. Another point of pressure is attempts to fuel the local anti-Russian nationalism in Belarus.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about Western attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations and Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia, specifically alleging Western activities to compromise Belarusian identity.
The decision of the Swedish MFA to change the name standard for Belarus is the result of a public debate that has been ongoing for several years.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Belarus faces either normal development under Russia or a forced Polonization and economic devastation, that the Eastern Partnership aims to erode Belarusian identity and promote the views of Polish gentry, that Belarus will turn into anti-Russia in case it does not deepen integration with Russia, and putting forward a ridiculous false dilemma, claiming that the only possible scenario for Belarus to prevent descent into Nazism through the politicisation of national clothes is to become a Russian western federal area.",REAL

The design capacity of the plant after the modification is 70 million cubic meters per day in direct mode, and 4 million cubic meters in reverse. Ukraine in the next year and a half will be able to count on a four-fold increase in gas supplies from the United States - about six billion cubic meters per year, according to previously authorized by the Polish government on Peter Naimsky strategic energy infrastructure. The head of Naftogaz Andrey Kobolev confirms that after the testing of the compressor station ""Komarno"" in Lviv region accessible for imports from Poland, capacity will increase to 6.6 billion cubic meters per year. This is about half of the annual needs of Ukraine in gas imports, said Kobolev. While the system is pumping gas from Poland to Ukraine really possible to transport up to 2 billion cubic meters of fuel per year uninterrupted basis. Restriction to increase exports to Ukraine at the moment is the capacity of gas pipelines in the direction of Poland, Silesia Subcarpathia, but the Polish infrastructure will extend no later than 2021. Despite this, Ukraine has already achieved independence from Russian gas monopoly says Kobolev. According to him, in 2013 Ukraine was dependent on 90% of Russia in the issue of gas supplies. It also led to political dependence. After the rejection of direct gas purchases from Gazprom Naftogaz increased amount of gas suppliers to 18, despite the fact that the proportion of one of them does not exceed 30%. Besides, he added Kobolev, Ukraine for the most part covers the needs of Ukrainian consumers natural gas extraction.
""Recently, for the first time put the US liquefied natural gas to Ukraine. Market mechanisms do what politicians could do for decades - Ukraine deprived gas and political dependence on Russian ...

652,"THE BALTICS HAVE LOST INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, AND POPULATION AS A RESULT OF EU MEMBERSHIP
","SUMMARY
As a result of their membership in the EU, the Baltic States have lost industry and agriculture and a third of their populations. During Soviet times, the Baltic republics where certain showcases; their cultural levels were improved thanks to other Soviet peoples. The Baltic States’ establishments thought this would continue to be the case. Instead, they have again returned to the boondocks, the place that they always had in Europe.
DISPROOF
This case is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about socio-economic degradation in the Baltic States as opposed to their alleged well-being under the USSR. In fact, the economic situation of all three Baltic States is strong and demonstrates some of the leading economic growth indicators in the EU. The dynamics over the past years are available here.

653,ANTI-RUSSIAN POSITION HELPED NATO COUNTRIES TEMPORARILY FREEZE A DRIFT IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS,"SUMMARY
A split between western European countries and more recent EU member states occurred right after the EU and NATO expansion. Pro-US eastern European and Baltic states eagerly take part in American projects which heighten tension in relations with Russia, whereas founding EU countries show greater restraint. For a short period of time NATO countries united around anti-Russian position after Ukrainian coup d’etat, but currently, are drifting apart again.
DISPROOF
This publication is one of many disinformation cases about the US military presence in Europe. It is consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about aggressive, anti-Russian Western policies and a coup d'etat in Ukraine. It groundlessly alleges that NATO countries are kept together only thanks to consolidation around their anti-Russian positions.
There was no coup d’état in Ukraine in 2014. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was a reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s violent dispersal of peaceful student protests against his sudden decision to withdraw from the Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. See the full debunk here.

In 2009 the US and Georgia signed a US-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, which advances bilateral cooperation on priority areas, such as defence and security; economic, trade, and energy issues; people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Read more about US-Georgia relations.
According to the statistical data released by Geostat (1996-2019), the first U.S. investments appeared in 1997 and amounted to USD 96 651.9 thousand. According to the data for 1997, the United States was the largest investor, followed by Australia, the United Kingdom and Austria. In coming years, other counties took the lead by the number of investments. In the second quarter of 2019, the United States came third after Turkey and the Netherlands by the amount of foreign direct investments.

659,THE WEST WILL SUPPORT ANTI-RUSSIAN UKRAINE UNTIL RUSSIA TAKES OVER NOVOROSSIYA,"SUMMARY
Ancient Rome’s politician Cato the Elder was famous for his regular calls to destroy Carthage. Similarly, today’s regular demand should be: “To destroy Ukrainian Carthage.” Novorossiya is the way to re-unite Russian people and the most effective response to Ukrainian challenge posed to Russia, the Russian World, the Orthodox Church, and the Ukrainian people itself. The West will always need Ukraine as an anti-Russian outpost, as a decaying ferment, as a territory under economic control and a source of the slave labour force. Ukraine will play this role until it owns the lands of historical Novorossiya. They are of strategic importance for Russia, given their access to seas, large population, industrial and agricultural potential. The reunification of Novorossiya with Russia will strengthen Russian statehood, its demographic and economic might.
The Minsk agreements which disregard Novorossiya is a way to nowhere. Once Ukraine gets control over the border with Russia, all constitutional amendments will be revoked within an hour, the leaders of autonomy will be arrested, and regional military bodies will be disarmed. Implementing the Minsk agreements will not change Ukraine as an anti-Russian country, but DPR/LPR and the trust of their population will be lost. The return of DPR/LPR under Kyiv’s control would have a negative psychological effect in Donbas and would be taken by Russians as a betrayal of national interests by the Russian ruling elite.
There is no good reason for Russia to allow Ukraine to get DPR/LPR back. The entry of Ukraine into NATO and the EU will not happen in any case: keeping Ukraine under Western political, economic and military control – something that is already the case – is easier and cheaper than giving Ukraine a full-fledged membership. At the same time, larger Ukraine’s involvement in the Eurasian integration will not prevent the development of Russophobia in the country. Russia’s actual strategic goal is the reunification of historic Russian lands and Russian people. The way to achieve it is the same as it happened to Crimea, that is the partition of Ukraine. Russia needs to follow Catherine the Great’s strategy who decided to partition Rzeczpospolita to reunite historic Russian territories.
DISPROOF
This publication is an illustrative example of anti-Ukrainian propaganda centred around Russian historical revisionism and Novorossiya concept.
Novorossiya is a geographic title for southern and eastern Ukraine, which served as an ideological pretext for Kremlin to destabilise Ukraine in 2014. Oleg Tsarev, a former Ukrainian parliamentarian, left Ukraine for Russia in 2014 and called for the creation of the so-called ‘Federal Republic of Novorossiya’. He then became a self-proclaimed speaker of Novorossiya's parliament and was sanctioned by the European Union for activities threatening Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In May 2015 DPR/LNP leaders announced that Novorossiya project is shut down.
This publication also contains pro-Kremlin propagandistic claims about Ukraine as Western anti-Russian project and Ukraine under Western control. Furthermore, it presents DPR/LPR as legitimate pro-Russian entities which should not be reintegrated into Ukraine.
Ukraine is recognised in international law as a sovereign nation-state, with its own flag, nationality, language and with a democratically-elected president and parliament. The claims that Ukraine is under complete Western control is groundless. The US and the European Union continue to support Ukraine, its territorial integrity, and sovereignty against Russian aggression.

660,"MANUFACTURERS OF ELECTRIC CARS AND LOCAL FASCISTS BEHIND BOLIVIAN COUP: HUNT OF INDIANS, RISK OF ETHNOCIDE","SUMMARY
A few years ago colossal deposits of lithium were discovered in Bolivia. Big corporations are in urgent need of access to lithium, a key metal for the production of electric car batteries. Hence it totally can be that the coup was lobbied by the heads of big American manufacturers of electric cars. We also have good reason to believe that the key role in the coup belonged to Bolivian military elite and the heads of intelligence services, who were driven by personal ambitions and racist sentiments towards local Indian population. A military coup in Bolivia was fascist. Interim president Janine Áñez announced hunt of Aymara and Quechua peoples, who make more than a half of Bolivian population. The risk is Bolivian fascist fundamentalists will not only take over deposits of natural resources, but will start ethnocide with the complicity of the US and its satellites.
DISPROOF
This publication claims without any proof that the US electric cars manufactures and local fascists staged the coup in Bolivia and that Interim president Janine Áñez announced the hunt of the Aymara and Quechua peoples. It is an example of a recurrent disinformation narrative about US-led regime change operations against left-wing governments in Latin America. Other examples of this narrative include the alleged presence of a US marine in the Venezuelan barricades and the promotion of a Ukraine-style 'colour revolution', the training of Venezuelan exiles in Guyana for military operations inside the country, preparations for a military intervention after forcing Brazil to join NATO, deliberate blackouts in South America caused by the US and the existence of plans for the secession of oil-rich regions in both Venezuela and Mexico.
This narrative also falls within the broader pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative attempting to deny the existence of genuine grass-roots protests, portraying them as foreign-led efforts and fake colour revolutions.
Read earlier disinformation cases claiming that Bolivia became a US target because of its lithium reserves, that the US overthrew the Bolivian president by a military junta when Maidan techniques did not help, that the US Intelligence co-opted Bolivian security services, and that the US waged hybrid wars against Venezuela and Bolivia.",REAL

665,"THE RUSSIAN THREAT IS ‘AN INVENTION’ OF THOSE WHO WANT TO BENEFIT FROM IT
","SUMMARY
The Russian threat is ‘an invention’ of those who want to benefit from their “role of the advance department in the fight against Russia”.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on Western belligerence towards Russia claiming that the “Russian threat” is a false idea.
While aware of pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns, the West is trying to keep open channels of communications with Russia, but not to invent the 'Russian threat' in order to 'fight against Russia'. After the end of the Cold War until the 2014 Ukraine crisis, most US and Western policymakers no longer viewed Russia as an adversary, instead, taking the opinion that it could potentially become, or already was, a credible and responsible partner for Western states.
For instance, NATO created cooperation bodies – the Permanent Joint Council and the NATO-Russia Council – to embody its relationship with Russia. It also invited Russia to cooperate on missile defence. The Warsaw Summit Communique 2016 describes NATO's official policy towards Russia: ""The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia. But we cannot, and will not, compromise on the principles on which our Alliance and security in Europe and North America rest."" However, since the Ukraine crisis, NATO has been genuinely concerned about the security challenges posed by Russia to Transatlantic security.
Russia’s annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine in early 2014 was widely viewed both in North America and in Europe as violating the basic rules of the post-Cold War European order, especially the rule that borders are inviolable and states should not use force to alter them or take territory from other states. As a result of Russia’s aggressive actions in Ukraine, many Western states - including key EU members such as Germany and France - critically reassessed their “strategic partnership” policies towards Russia and began to view Russia as a serious challenge to the European security order.

666,OPPRESSION OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE PROVOKED WAR IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
Language is what provoked the war [in Donbas]. When this happened, why did they adopt the law banning the Russian language when we have an 85% to 90% Russian-speaking population?
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, the Euromaidan and the status of the Russian language in Ukraine.
The war in Eastern Ukraine was provoked by the pro-Russian separatists and the mercenaries funded and supported directly by Russia. There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The international community, including the European Union, recognises and condemns clear violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014 when Russia intervened in Crimea and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula on March 16, 2014.
The war was not provoked by language issues. On the contrary, many Ukrainian citizens from the predominantly Russian speaking Southern and Eastern oblasts actively participated in the events in the Euromaidan and supported the European integration of Ukraine. According to a survey, 27% of Euromaidan participants were Russian speakers and 18% were bilinguals.
It is not true that 85-90% of the Ukrainian population is Russian-speaking. According to the latest survey, 27% of Ukrainian citizens use the Russian language in their everyday communication; the Ukrainian language is preferred by 51% of Ukrainians and 21% are bilinguals.
The law on regional languages was repealed by the parliament of Ukraine on February 23, 2014. However, the decree was not signed. The law officially expired only on February 28, 2018, when the Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared the law unconstitutional. Additionally, the Constitution of Ukraine protects the languages of national minorities.",REAL
667,NATO’S SPACE PLAN WILL LEAD TO DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES,"SUMMARY
Americans bet on the militarisation of Space, and their main task is to conduct all kinds of military operations outside the national territories. Therefore, NATO works in three areas of military operations: in the geocentric near-Earth cyberspace, on Earth’s electromagnetic field and poles control aiming to take under control the existing climate chaos, and on the planet’s gravitational field.
All these will lead to the disastrous consequences for the entire world community. The nuclear weapons will simply seem like baby babble.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about NATO, portraying Alliance as a threat because of aggressive agenda, claiming that American and NATO policies are a threat to world peace and security. All added up with a conspiracy theory on US/NATO forces performing experiments with climate weapons.
In June 2019, Defence Ministers agreed NATO’s first-ever space policy. Space should be a new operational domain for NATO – alongside air, land, sea and cyber. They recognized that space is part of our daily lives, and while it can be used for peaceful purposes, it can also be used for aggression: ""Satellites can be hacked, jammed, or weaponised. Anti-satellite weapons could cripple communications. It is therefore important that we are vigilant and resilient – also in space.”

Any government that attempts to nationalise its country’s resources, instead of selling them off, is struck by Western-sponsored colored revolutions.

Conspiracy theory. No evidence is given.
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that depicts colour revolutions as attempts by the West to overthrow unwelcome regimes in post-Soviet states and in other regions, and as Western-sponsored efforts to subvert governments seeking to regain national sovereignty and control over national resources.
According to this narrative, which has been recently applied also to explain protests in Venezuela, and in Bolivia any civil uprising is not spontaneous, but is supported, if not outright organised by the West, which is portrayed as an aggressive actor constantly preparing new coups.

Without integration in humanitarian and political spheres, economic integration between Belarus and Russia will not be durable.

Belarus should also introduce the “foreign agent” concept just as Russia did.
DISPROOF
This case is an illustrative example of recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about the all-Russian nation and Russian world/civilization. The ""all-Russian nation"" is an imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Belarusians and Ukrainians, as well as their sovereignty. It also puts forward recurring propagandistic narratives about Western attempts to organise a colour revolution in Belarus and elsewhere, Ukraine as an anti-Russian tool under external control, Western attempts to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations, and Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia.
Belarus and Ukraine are well-defined nation-states with a long history; both nations preserved language, literature and identity, despite foreign rule for long periods. The West does not aim at tearing Belarus from Russia nor at organizing a colour revolution in Belarus. Ukraine is a sovereign state, not controlled by any foreign government. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world, including the EU, but has been continuously violated by Russia since February 2014.

671,CLIMATE ACTIVISTS WANT TO DESTROY PROGRESS IN THE NAME OF GREEN FAITH,"SUMMARY
Climate activists don’t appreciate the progress their parents and grandparents have made with sweat on their faces. They don’t realise that they are so well off right now, not because of their own diligence, but because of this legacy, which they want to destroy in the name of green faith. Ecologism, not ecology!
It is precisely thanks to previous generations that university occupiers and fans of the terrifying Greta can travel easily, enjoy technological progress, and democracy as well.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation effort to delegitimise climate activism and propagate denialism about climate change.
Climate change is a scientific fact. Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down rain-forests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming. Preventing dangerous consequences of the climate change is the  key priority for the EU. 
This claim also attacks Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who is a frequent target of pro-Kremlin disinformation.

672,US AND EUROPE LEGITIMISED COUP D’ETAT IN UKRAINE IN 2014,"SUMMARY
None of them [the leaders of the protests on the Maidan] would have gone for a coup if the United States together with Europe had not given them guarantees of the legitimisation of their power. They attacked Yanukovych after they were given guarantees that they would be recognised as the representatives of the new government.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative painting the 2013-14 protests in Kyiv as a coup orchestrated by the West.
There was no coup in Ukraine six years ago. The demonstrations which began in Kyiv in November 2013 – called ""Maidan"", or ""Euromaidan"" – were not provoked or legitimised from outside but were a result of the Ukrainian people's frustration with former President Yanukovych's last-minute U-turn when, after seven years of negotiation, he refused to sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement and halted progress towards Ukraine's closer relationship with the EU as a result of Russian pressure. The protesters' demands included constitutional reform, a stronger role for parliament, formation of a government of national unity, an end to corruption, early presidential elections and an end to violence.
The West did not interfere in Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine is a sovereign state. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world, including the EU. The EU and the US work closely with Ukraine and support the democratic development of Ukraine in accordance with the UN Charter’s principles of non-interference into internal affairs and respect towards territorial integrity and political independence.",REAL
673,"THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIA’S PRESENCE IN DONBAS
","SUMMARY
If there were any evidence of Russia’s presence in Donbas, it would be all over the world’s media and monstrous sanctions would have followed, yet OSCE says there are no Russian troops there.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, claiming that Russia is not part of the conflict in Donbas, that Russia has nothing to do with the war in eastern Ukraine and that there is a “civil war” in Donbas.
There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The EU condemns the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"". At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014, NATO leaders condemned in the strongest terms Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine and demanded Russia to stop and withdraw its forces from Ukraine and from the country’s border. NATO leaders also demanded Russia complies with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine.
Forensic Architecture, a London-based research group, has collected and catalogued evidence of Russian military involvement in the battle of Ilovaysk in August 2014, including the presence of a model of tank used only by the Russian armed forces at that time.
Russian media often claimed that OSCE denies Russian presence in Donbas. Claims that the OSCE did not find evidence of Russian presence in eastern Ukraine goes against statements of the former First Deputy Chief Monitor to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine, Alexander Hug. It is not the first time that such claims have been made.  
In an interview, delivered in Autumn 2018, Hug mentions that the Mission has been recording the instances of Russia's involvement in the war in Donbas (in Eastern Ukraine). ""We have been seeing at least in six instances convoys leaving and entering Ukraine, which we have been documenting, which have been driving towards the unsecured border with the Russian Federation in the middle of the night, on dirt roads, and have been seen at the border in areas where there is no official border crossing,"" Hug said.

This is about a statement by former US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland in late 2013, in the midst of the Dignity Revolution in Ukraine (video from 07:27). Then she said that the United States has invested $5 billion in more than 20 years to develop democratic processes and reforms in Ukraine. The diplomat said that this is the total amount of assistance that Washington has allocated to Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Money was allocated for fair elections, to fight corruption and to develop the energy sector. Victoria Nuland later frequently repeated these theses, including in various interviews. ",REAL

The Ukrainian government does not fulfil the key requirement of the Minsk agreements on direct negotiations with the leadership of the LNR and the DNR.

This is a common Kremlin narrative that Ukraine refuses to implement the Minsk agreements.
Since 2014, negotiations with Russia to resolve the conflict in the Donbas have been held within the framework of the Normandy format and the Minsk process. A special Trilateral contact group is working on a peaceful settlement of the situation in Donbas. Three parties are involved in this process: representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE. Unofficially, representatives of the ""LDNR"" factions are also present.
The second set of measures to implement the Minsk agreements was signed on 12 February 2015. The first paragraph of the document relates to an immediate ceasefire. Next, it is necessary to withdraw heavy weapons, ensure OSCE monitoring, release prisoners, grant Donbas special status and hold local elections, amnesty the parties to the conflict and restore control over the Ukrainian-Russian border in the conflict zone.

Ukraine never existed as an independent state. The country is under external control.

Another conspiracy theory that the United States and the European Union control Ukraine’s foreign and domestic policies.
Ukraine is an independent state whose sovereignty is respected both in the EU and in the USA. The United States recognised Ukraine as an independent state on December 25, 1991. Since then, Washington has been working closely with Ukraine, directing its assistance to support the development of a safe, democratic, prosperous and free Ukraine, fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. The European Union also supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. Ukraine is a priority partner for the EU. In June 2014, the EU and Ukraine signed an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, which promotes deeper political ties, stronger economic links and the respect for common values.
The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine are respected by most of the free world but were violated by Russia in 2014.

The Holodomor theme is a term that appeared in the Cold War as an element of anti-Soviet propaganda. There was no famine in Ukraine because there is no documentary evidence of this.
DISPROOF
This is another disinformation narrative claiming that there was no artificially created famine in Ukraine. The Holodomor is well documented and was not made up as anti-Soviet propaganda during the Cold War. The genocide in Ukraine in 1932-1933 is confirmed by a huge array of declassified documents, including official documents of the Soviet authorities and the Communist Party. The Security Service of Ukraine has declassified more than 5,000 pages of state archives about the Holodomor.
The Holodomor was an artificial famine created with the aim of destroying the Ukrainian peasantry. The Soviets took away livestock, crops and seeds from the peasants under the guise that the peasants ""plundered"" state property. The Soviet law on the seizure of food from peasants was adopted in 1932. The punitive document is known as the ""Five Spikelet Law"". Everyone who gathered several ears of wheat on the collective farm field was a culprit in the ""theft of state property"". If the law was not enforced, people were shot, including children. Convicts were not subject to amnesty.
The famine of 1932-1933 claimed the lives of 7 to 10 million citizens of the Soviet Union; the disaster affected not only Ukraine but also parts of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova and Russia.
In 2006, the Verkhovna Rada officially recognised the Holodomor of 1932-33 as a genocide of the Ukrainian people.

Moscow has repeatedly stated that the population of Crimea has voted to reunite with Russia through democratic means, in full compliance with international law and the UN Charter.

No international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014.
A year after the illegal annexation, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.""
On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
The EU's policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity. In March 2019 on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.

","SUMMARY
On the predicament in which Kiev put Moscow, on the issue of transit of gas to Europe, the latter, from the first of January, .., with a complete cessation of gas transit (from Russia).. could face energy problems.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative blaming Ukraine for the disruption to the gas talks between Russia and Ukraine and plans to cut gas transit from Russia to the EU.
Europe is not ""catastrophically lacking gas"". On the contrary, there is enough natural gas supply resulting in a fall in prices in Europe this year. This is because the continent has been flooded with liquefied natural gas (LNG) from a number of suppliers since Autumn 2018, including the United States. A mild winter in Asia has driven gas prices to a three-year-low and caused LNG shipments to be redirected to Europe, pushing down the prices. As Polygraph explains, energy experts say LNG has allowed natural gas to become a global commodity that can easily move from one continent to another depending on demand, similar to the way oil is traded.",REAL
690,WHITE HELMETS’ OBJECTIVE IS TO DISCREDIT DAMASCUS,"SUMMARY
The White Helmets are part of a media campaign that targets the reputation of the Syrian authorities, they were also blamed for the provocation that led to the West accusing Damascus of using chemical weapons which directed the bombarding of governmental targets.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative targeting the White Helmets with many disinformation and propagandist claims.
White Helmets activists have documented the use of chemical weapons in Syria, later confirmed by The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  (OPCW). Thus, OPCW said it found reasonable grounds to believe that chlorine was used as a weapon in the Douma district of Eastern Ghouta, Syria in April 2018. Because of its activities, the organization has become the target of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign.

DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative painting the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests as a violent, Western-sponsored coup d'etat.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine.

692,THE US AND UK INTERFERE IN EUROPE’S AFFAIRS AND TRY TO DESTABILISE IT,"SUMMARY
The second most important reason [behind the destabilisation of the political situation in Europe] is the interference of outside powers, especially the United States and Britain, in the political life of continental Europe. The United States has no interest in reshaping the EU into a strong and capable structure. That would threaten America’s interests in Europe.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the US presence in Europe, portraying Europe as a vassal of the USA and trying to undermine the sovereignty of European countries. Additionally, the claim that the UK interferes in European affairs and aims to destabilise it is completely baseless and not backed up with any evidence.
In fact, the EU Member States are sovereign countries and make sovereign decisions about their own security and policies. The US is an important ally to the EU but EU policy is not determined by the US, as explained by the EU High Representative.
The EU maintains partnerships with the world's key players, including emerging powers and regional groups. It seeks to ensure that these relationships are based on mutual interests and benefits. For instance, the EU’s common foreign and security policy is designed to resolve conflicts and foster international understanding and is based on diplomacy and respect for international rules. Trade, humanitarian aid, and development cooperation also play an important role in the EU's international role.
The EU is in a prime position, when it comes to trade, as the EU is the largest economy in the world. The EU is the world’s largest trading bloc and external trade and investment have played a dynamic role in boosting its economic growth for many decades. Although growth is projected to be slow, the EU remains the largest economy in the world.",REAL
693,"NATO IS A RELIC OF THE COLD WAR
","SUMMARY
NATO is no longer a single military bloc. NATO is a relic of the Cold War. Since then, NATO is just a financial scheme. For those who pump money out of nothing. For the countries without economies, hoping for external military financing, аnd for the arms corporations.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, undermining NATO's role as a defensive military alliance. NATO is a defensive alliance, whose purpose is to protect its member states.
Concerning the claim, that NATO is the relic of the Cold War, at the London Summit in 1990, Allied heads of state and government agreed ""to keep standing together, to extend the long peace"". This was their sovereign choice and was fully in line with their right for collective defence. Since then, thirteen more countries have chosen to join NATO. Twice since the end of the Cold War, NATO has adopted new Strategic Concepts (in 1999 and 2010), adapting to new realities. Thus, rather than being disbanded as a relic, NATO adapted, and continues to change, to live up to the needs and expectations of Allies, and to promote their shared vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace.
After Russia’s annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the Readiness Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defence and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment.
Apart from that, NATO membership is not a financial scheme for profit. Member countries make direct and indirect contributions to the costs of running NATO and implementing its policies and activities. The defence expenditure of NATO members ""represent payments by a national government actually made, or to be made, during the course of the fiscal year to meet the needs of its armed forces, those of Allies or of the Alliance."" In 2006, NATO Defence Ministers agreed to commit a minimum of two per cent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for defence expenditures. According to NATO, the defence capacity of each member country has an important impact on the overall perception of the Alliance’s credibility as a politico-military organisation.
See several other anti-NATO narratives such as NATO is monstrous Cold war relic, NATO cultivates Cold War thinking and considers Russia as an enemy, NATO is fully subordinated to the USA; Baltic states, Moldova, Poland are NATO “hostages”.",REAL
694,"RUSSIA HAS NOT, TO ANY EXTENT, EXERTED ANY FORM OF AGGRESSION, IT IS THE EU, WHICH IS AGGRESSIVE","SUMMARY
A simple chronological list of events in Europe would remind us that Russia has acted much less aggressively than the West, and has only responded step by step. Russia did not and does not, to any extent, exert any form of aggression. The EU and NATO are aggressive. This aggression is directed against Russia’s security interests.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Russophobia and about Western belligerence towards Russia.
While aware of pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns, the West is trying to keep open channels of communications and cooperation with Russia. For instance, NATO as the Western organisation created cooperation bodies – the Permanent Joint Council and the NATO-Russia Council – to embody its relationship with Russia. It also invited Russia to cooperate on missile defence. The Warsaw Summit Communique 2016 describes NATO's official policy towards Russia: ""The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia. But we cannot, and will not, compromise on the principles on which our Alliance and security in Europe and North America rest."" No other country outside the alliance has such a privileged relationship with NATO.
Also, NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Every sovereign nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security, one that Russia has also subscribed to and should respect. NATO enlargement has brought more stability and prosperity to Europe, including Russia.
The EU and its member states have maintained a clear policy of reaching out to Russian society and youth, mainly through the Erasmus+ student exchange programme and other people to people contacts, in line with five guiding principles of relations with Russia.

695,WHITE HELMETS DO NOTHING TO HELP CIVILIANS,"SUMMARY
The White Helmets are cooperating with the terrorist group “Hayat Tahrir al-Sham” (formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra).
What or who is hiding behind the White Helmets organization and why are they supported by the West? The White Helmets do nothing to help civilians, but instead, they cooperate with terrorists. Riam Dalati, a BBC producer in Syria, recently announced that the recording of the scene in the hospital after the chemical attack in the Syrian Douma region, which was claimed to have occurred in early April 2018, was fabricated.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the White Helmets. No evidence is given to substantiate the claim that they have connections to Al Qaeda and/ or other terrorist groups.
The claim that the White Helmets are the creation of “Western intelligence” is unsubstantiated and constitutes a groundless conspiracy theory.
The BBC didn't deny the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Douma. The tweet of BBC's producer Riam Dalati, the source of these claims, doesn't deny the chemical attack.
""The producer was expressing his personal opinions about some of the video footage that emerged after the attack but has not claimed that the attack did not happen,"" the BBC spokesperson told Sputnik.
In the Interim Report of the OPCW fact-finding mission in Syria regarding the incident of alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Douma, it is stated: ""Various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from Locations 2 and 4, along with residues of explosive."" (p. 2)",REAL
696,RUSSIAN ATHLETES FACE SANCTIONS BECAUSE OF WESTERN RUSSOPHOBIA AND RUSSIA’S COMPLIANCE,"SUMMARY
Why Russian athletes remain hostages of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which continues its flagrant Russophobia? Just because the WADA can afford to do it. In contrast to diplomatic, economic, military, energy spheres and others, Russian sport chose not to argue with the WADA, the International Association of Athletics Federations, etc. This is largely because the degree of globalisation and unipolarism is higher in sport than in the above mentioned spheres. Russian sport organisations have fulfilled all requirements in hope that this would solve the problems. These hopes were dashed. And this speaks for itself how right Russia was in all other spheres where it did not follow the West’s instructions. This story proves that Russia will be punished by the West simply because the latter can do so, not for Russia’s alleged wrongdoings.

700,POLISH AUTHORITIES USE FALSIFICATION OF HISTORY AS A TOOL FOR POLITICAL FIGHT WITH RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Falsification and re-writing of history on the example of Krakow clearly shows that the current and previous authorities of Poland interpret history in different ways using it as a tool for the political fight. In this situation, it is used for a fight with the Russian Federation.
DISPROOF
This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – it accuses Poland in “falsification and re-writing” of its history. According to this policy, the Russian official historiography is the only “true” way of interpretation of historical events for the countries of Eastern and Central Europe.
For decades, the Soviet authorities had spread the story about the heroic role of the Red Army in the saving of the Krakow Old Town from being blown up by retreating Nazi troops. Mainstream Polish historians do not share this view, perceiving this story as a post-war myth glorifying the Red Army among the Poles.
There is no substantial difference in perception of the key WWII events between the official Polish historical policy, opinions of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, opinions of mainstream Polish historians and attitudes of a predominant part of the Polish society. For example, from their point of view, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact directly caused the German and Soviet aggression at the Polish state in September 1939 and the Red Army occupied Poland in 1944-45, causing the undemocratic establishment of Communist Poland.
See similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning Poland - It is thanks to Russia that Poland today exists as a country, Nazi Germany considered Poland its best ally, USSR was forced and reluctant to sign Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.",REAL
701,RUSSIA RESTORED ITS RELATIONS WITH THE WEST BY DOING EVERYTHING CONTRARY TO THE LATTER’S WILL,"SUMMARY
Over the last few years, Russia has improved its position in world politics because it did not follow the others’ rules and orders. This was risky, but the strategy of compliance with the West’s instructions would definitely run Russia into a catastrophe. Many of the “Kremlin’s adventures” such as counter-sanctions, the military operation in Syria, import substitutions, construction of pipelines which the West initially ridiculed, have brought fruits and consequently contributed to the restoration of relations with the Western countries.
DISPROOF
The claim about Western plans to run Russian into a catastrophe is consistent with a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the West's deliberate anti-Russian activities. It misinterprets the dynamics of Russian-Western relations by alleging that they improved as a result of Russian activities in military and economic fields such as the introduction of counter-sanctions or assisting Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian war.
In fact, the EU has unanimously voted for continuation of the sanctions against Russia since they were introduced in 2014 and the US made sanctions against Russia stricter in August 2019. Therefore, Russian-Western relations have hardly been restored due to Russian military and economic measures as the articles claim.

No proof for the allegations made by the World Anti-Doping Agency’s committee was presented to the public so far. There are many theories why Russian sport continues to be ‘bullied’. Foremost, Russia is a strong sporting country, this is why others are scared of it and this is why the suspension of Russian athletes is beneficial to them. Russian representatives sit in many international sport federations and many dislike this too. The severity of penalties for guilty countries is different. No calls to suspend Norwegian or Americans for the doping scandals in winter sport and athletics were made. At the same time, the Russian doping scandal has become mainstream in the international sport community. Another version says that the whole doping story is revenge, organised by upset Englishmen for Russia’s winning the bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

A private army linked to the Kremlin has been fighting on the front lines of the Libyan war for nearly three months.
The Russian firm Wagner Group is a shadowy mercenary outfit waging secret wars on the Kremlin’s behalf from Ukraine to Syria to the Central African Republic. The Wagner group members are mostly ex-service personnel, fought clandestinely in support of Russian forces in Syria and Ukraine, according to Reuters interviews with dozens of contractors, their friends and relatives.
This is also a recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative that Russian ground troops are not active in Libya or Syria, while there is a wide spectrum of sources disproving this claim.

712,LIBERALISM LEADS TO THE TOTAL LOSS OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND TO WORLD GOVERNMENT,"SUMMARY
Liberalism proclaims that the sovereignty of national governments must be totally abolished by surrendering national power to supranational organizations and ultimately to a world government.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that seeks to discredit liberalism claiming that it is obsolete and that liberal societies are totalitarian systems ruled by “globalist elites” and “shadow governments” that rob nations of their sovereignty and identity
Liberalism is a political doctrine based on liberty, consent of the governed, individual rights (including civil rights and human rights), and equality before the law. Liberalism does NOT espouse the loss of national sovereignty nor the idea of world government.

715,POLISH LNG TERMINAL DOES NOT BRING FINANCIAL BENEFITS,"SUMMARY
Poland has to find a way to justify the existence of its LNG terminal, which does not bring any financial benefits to the state. Undoubtedly, the LNG deliveries through this terminal are less profitable than gas deliveries from Russia.
The gas terminal in Świnoujście is not sufficiently loaded and currently, the American LNG cannot replace the Russian gas.
DISPROOF
This case is a part of the Kremlin's disinformation campaign about the Polish LNG terminal in Świnoujście and the Polish energy policy in general.
The construction of the LNG Terminal in Świnoujście was completed in 2015, which enabled Poland to start importing the LNG from the United States and Qatar. The functioning of this terminal has resulted in a visible reduction of the share of the Russian gas in total Polish consumption - 67% in 2018  and 58% in the first three quarters of 2019.
Throughout 2017-2019, Poland signed several large long-term delivery contracts with the LNG suppliers from Qatar and the USA. The increasing LNG import to Poland has caused the necessity to expand the regasification capacities of the LNG Terminal from 5 to 7.5 billion cubic meters per year.
According to the statement of the Head of the Polish state-owned energy concern PGNiG Piotr Woźniak, the deliveries of the American LNG are cheaper than the Russian gas by over 20%.

716,RUSSIA IS NOT A PART OF THE CONFLICT IN DONBAS AND CANNOT FULFIL THE MINSK AGREEMENTS,"SUMMARY
Russia is not a part of the conflict in Donbas and cannot fulfil the Minsk agreements.
Some Moscow partners are demanding that the Minsk peace agreements for the Donbas be fulfilled. But this is impossible because Russia is not a part of the conflict and is not even mentioned in this agreement.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine, claiming that Russia is not part of the conflict in Donbas and that Russia has nothing to do with the war in Eastern Ukraine.
The Minsk agreements (the 2014 memorandum and 2015 plan of action) is the roadmap to the stabilisation of the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. It is true that both documents do not mention Russia as a side involved in the war, however, the documents do not mention the sides whatsoever. Still, the Minsk agreements do not define the conflict in Ukraine as ""internal"" but state clearly (paragraph 10) the need to withdraw “all foreign armed formations, military equipment, as well as mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine under the monitoring of the OSCE.”
There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The EU condemns the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"". At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014 and at successive summits since then, NATO leaders condemned Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine in the strongest terms and demanded that Russia stop and withdraw its forces from Ukraine and along the country’s border. NATO leaders also demanded that Russia complies with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; end its illegitimate occupation of Crimea; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
The so-called People's republics DNR and LNR receive humanitarian, financial and military backing from Russia. An InformNapalm study shows that thirty-one weapons systems found in the Donbas entered service with the Russian military between 2004 and 2015 and have never been produced in, or sold to, Ukraine.
In 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted Russia's military presence in Ukraine.

DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin conspiracy theory targeting Greta Thunberg and accusing the West of allegedly exploiting the environmental agenda and climate change topic for self-serving reasons, and as a means to weaken Russia.
Climate change is a scientific fact. Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down rain-forests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming.

On the date of its announcement, the 27th of  March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution entitled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine”, stating that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula.

721,UKRAINE BUYS EXPENSIVE GAS FROM EUROPE JUST TO SPITE RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Ukraine wants cheap gas but will buy it at high prices from Europe just to spite [Russia]. To pay 2 or 3 times more, doesn’t matter.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the gas supply negotiations between Ukraine and Russia
In November 2015, Kyiv refused to purchase gas for the state’s needs from the Russian monopolist Gazprom. At the moment, all the gas used by Ukraine is acquired exclusively on its western borders.
In the summer of this year, Naftogaz of Ukraine reported that at the moment Ukraine is buying gas at an open auction in the EU, at almost half the price that Russia offers. For example, in July, Ukraine bought gas for the needs of the population at $178 per 1000 cubic meters, while Russia's Gazprom offered Kyiv a price of $315. Moreover, the Ukrainian company Naftogaz previously won a court case with Gazprom for gas supplies for state needs. Naftogaz estimates the overall positive effect of the arbitration award at more than tens of billion USD over the entire duration of the contract for gas supplies to Ukraine.",REAL
722,"UKRAINE PRIME MINISTER MISSION: STOP THE TRANSIT OF RUSSIAN GAS THROUGH UKRAINE, STEAL EVERYTHING FROM THE PEOPLE","SUMMARY
Who in the last 6 years considered the opinion of the Ukrainian people? There is the opinion of the US, the EU, oligarchs and Soros whom Honcharuk serves. All of them are only using the Ukrainian people and especially Honcharuk. His mission is to stop the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine so that the US can sell its own liquefied gas, and steal everything from the people. After that Ukraine can be closed as a project.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative blaming Ukraine for the disruption of the gas talks between Russia and Ukraine and plans to cut gas transit from Russia to the EU. Mixed in there is another often encountered pro-Kremlin disinformation claim blaming the US for trying to monopolise the EU gas market.
Ukraine has made it clear that it is interested in and ready to continue the transit of gas from Russia to the EU. On 19 September 2019, during the third round of trilateral gas talks between the EU, Ukraine, and Russia, the Ukrainian delegation confirmed its willingness to sign a new contract for the duration of 10 years under the EU law. Ukraine’s Naftogaz handed over a draft interconnection agreement and a draft standard transmission agreement to Gazprom. Naftogaz reaffirmed its willingness to sign a new contract during the fourth round of negotiations held in Brussels on 28 October.
The claim that the U.S. is planning to monopolise the European gas market is an exaggeration. According to Eurostat, Russia was, and remains, the largest supplier of natural gas and petroleum to the EU. Moreover, it has increased its share over the past few years. Whereas in 2017 Russia accounted for 39.3% of all gas imports, in 2018 its share increased to 40.2%. The other large suppliers of natural gas are Norway (35% in 2018), Algeria (11.3%), Qatar (5.8%), and other suppliers – 7.7%. It is the same situation with petroleum where Russia's share is 27.3%; Norway is in second place with 11.2%.
As of 2018-2019, the U.S. is only the third biggest supplier of LNG to Europe with a share of 12.6% of all EU LNG imports. For the U.S., EU is also not the biggest purchaser, since it accounts only for 10% of all U.S. LNG exports. Overall, from August 2018 until April 2019, the EU bought in from the U.S. 10.4 billion cubic metres of gas. To compare, in 2018 Russia’s gas exports to the EU reached 202 bcm which set a record.",REAL
723,"FASCISTS AND TERRORISTS RULE UKRAINE, IT IS TOTALLY LIKE HITLER’S NAZI GERMANY","SUMMARY
How can we discuss the territorial integrity of Ukraine, where the power belongs to fascists and terrorists? When the US and EU speak that violations of Ukraine’s territorial integrity are unacceptable, this is the same as to agree that violations of territorial integrity of Hitler’s Germany were unacceptable either. This logic implies that Adolf Hitler had the same right of appeal to international principles of Reich’s territorial integrity as present-time Ukrainian fascists.

Sanctions against Russia were imposed under the pretext of the events in Ukraine. The West says, if Russia wants the EU to lift sanctions, it should fulfill the Minsk agreements. But Russia is not mentioned in the agreement. Russia is the member of Normandy Four, which formed the framework of the Minsk agreement.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on Ukraine and the Minsk agreements. Also consistent with the narrative about the US global role.
The narrative claims that Russia is not part of the conflict in Donbas and that Russia has nothing to do with the war in eastern Ukraine.
The Minsk agreements (the 2014 memorandum and 2015 plan of action) is the roadmap to the stabilisation of the situation in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk.

728,POLAND CONTRIBUTED TO THE GENOCIDE OF CHRISTIANS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,"SUMMARY
The present-day Polish politicians criticising the Red Army’s soldiers, evade responsibility for participating in wars in the Middle East, which destroys peace in that region. The politicians of the Law and Justice Party denying the Red Army’s role in the fight against Hitler can be burdened with guilt for the wars in the Middle East, supporting the USA and NATO. In the future, Poland may have to compensate military damage to countries such as Iraq. Poland has contributed to the genocide of Christians taking place in the Middle East as a consequence of the wars in this region carried out with the participation of the USA and NATO.
DISPROOF
This message includes two separate disinformation narratives. The first narrative is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism (accusing Poland of falsifying and re-writing its history as it states that the USSR and the Red Army occupied this country at the end of WWII). The second narrative includes various anti-US and anti-NATO conspiracy claims, accusing them of committing various crimes and atrocities all over the World.
According to official Polish historical policy, opinions of mainstream Polish historians and attitudes of a predominant part of the Polish society, the Red Army occupied Poland in 1944-45, causing the undemocratic establishment of Communist Poland.
No evidence is provided regarding the claim on the alleged Polish contribution to the genocide of Christians in the Middle East. Polish military forces were present in Iraq within the US-led Multi-National Force throughout 2003-2008 (military conflict and stabilisation) and until 2011 (several dozen officers within a NATO Training Mission).
In recent years, the Polish Government and NGOs have been actively involved in various humanitarian projects aimed at assisting civilians and refugees in Syria and Iraq. See some of these projects here - Polish Aid for Syria; Polish Humanitarian Action – activities in Syria and Iraq; Polish Centre for International Aid – assistance to Syrian refugees in Lebanon.

729,RED ARMY ENTERING POLAND DID NOT PLAN TO SEIZE THIS COUNTRY,"SUMMARY
When the Red Army was entering Poland, there was no talk about the seizing of Poland by the USSR after the end of WWII. This situation was changed only at the conferences of the Big Three (USSR, USA, UK) at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam. It was Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill who took decisions on the post-war order – the Red Army soldiers did not decide that Poland should be in the sphere of Soviet interests. We cannot say that the soldiers fallen in the fight with Hitler died in order to establish Communism in Poland. The refusal to accept the fact that the Red Army soldiers liberated Poland from the German occupation is the denial of history, which is immoral.
DISPROOF
This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism – Russia keeps denying the fact of military and political occupation of Poland by the USSR at the end of WWII (switching the responsibility for this situation on Roosevelt and Churchill).
The claim that the Soviet authorities did not plan to occupy Poland in the moment of the Red Army’s entering into this country goes against historical facts. First of all, immediately after the entering of the Red Army on the present-day territory of Poland (July 1944), the Soviet authorities established the so-called Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), which was formed of Polish communists and appeared under full control of the USSR. In December 1944, this Committee was turned into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland, which started to be perceived by the USSR as legitimate Polish authorities since January 1945. In this way, at the very beginning of Red Army’s entrance to Poland, the USSR established its own “puppet” authorities, which became the Government of Communist Poland.
During the Tehran Conference in November-December 1943, there was no talk about the post-war political fate of Poland – the USSR, UK, and US discussed only the changes in the eastern and western borders of post-war Poland.
By the beginning of the Yalta Conference (February 1945), the USSR had control over a significant part of Polish territory, including Warsaw. Also, it had formally recognized its “puppet” Provisional Government as the legitimate Polish authorities. In this situation, the USSR presented their control over Poland to the Western allies as an accomplished fact. The USSR obliged to organize free elections in Poland after the end of WWII, but this obligation was never realized. De facto, Poland appeared under the Soviet military occupation until 1989.

730,TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS UPDATING OPERATION CONDOR IN LATIN AMERICA FOR THE XXIST CENTURY,"SUMMARY
US president Donald Trump’s fixation is to root out Socialists. The Latin American left warned of a resurgence of Operation Condor in the XXI century, this time through updated methods. After taking part in the coup in Bolivia, the US reinforced sanctions against Nicaragua’s left-wing government and is now pointing to Mexico, where it could use the excuse of the designation of drug trafficking organisations as terrorist groups for direct military intervention.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. No evidence is provided to support the claim that there is an 'Operation Condor of the XXIst century', nor the alleged US involvement in the events in Bolivia or that the US government wants to designate drug trafficking organisations as terrorist groups for a military intervention in Mexico.
Operation Condor was a US-backed, coordinated intelligence operation from 1968 to 1989, formally institutionalised in 1975, between right-wing Latin American dictatorships, whose intelligence services illegally tracked down, kidnapped, murdered or forcefully disappeared thousands of political opponents across the continent. At least 50,000 killings were documented by the perpetrators. Nothing of a similar scale in any count has been suggested by any serious observer in these times.
This is part of a recurrent Russian disinformation narrative about constant US plots to undermine Latin American governments. You can see many examples in our database, such as an alleged CIA-led Twitter campaign and a hybrid war in Bolivia, the engineering of blackouts all over Latin America, the promotion of secessionism in Mexico or Venezuela, the training of Venezuelan exiles in Guyana for military operations inside the country or preparations for a military intervention in that country after forcing Brazil to join NATO.",REAL
731,RUSSIA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DONBAS CONFLICT,"SUMMARY
As for the conflict in Donbas, Russia has repeatedly asserted that it is not a part of it, blaming the Ukrainian authorities for the continuing clashes in the region.
DISPROOF
One of the most common disinformation narratives about the ""conflict"" in Donbas, claiming that Russia has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine. See a similar case denying Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The EU has condemned the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.
In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted in 2015 Russia's military presence in Ukraine",REAL
732,UKRAINE BROKE THE MINSK AGREEMENTS BY ALLOWING THE NATIONAL POLICE ON THE CONTACT LINE,"SUMMARY
Ukraine knows that it can’t allow the National Police to be on the line of contact [in Donbas]. It violates the agreements. And Ukraine broke the agreement before the Normandy Format meeting.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Minsk agreements, portraying Ukraine as the only violator of the agreements. See previous cases about the Minsk agreements and the war in Ukraine.
On 20 September 2016, the Framework Decision of Tripartite Contact Group on the Withdrawal of Forces was signed. The document listed violations such as the movement of forces and means on the contact line, shelling or placing mines on the contact line, etc. However, there is no mention of the use of the National Police for controlling order there.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Andrii Zagorodniuk said in October 2019 that the condition of the withdrawal of forces and means is the fulfilment of the condition of observing the ceasefire regime at both sections of the contact line and the verification of the absence of fire should be carried out by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. He also stated that the National Police will protect civilians on the contact line.",REAL
733,UKRAINE WAS RELUCTANT TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
Over the last five years, the conflict [in Donbas] has not been resolved not because of the position of the “DPR” and “LPR”, but because of Kyiv’s reluctance to achieve a peaceful settlement.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the Minsk agreements and the War in Ukraine.
Former and current presidents of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have made it clear that the strategic goal of Ukraine is to achieve peace in Donbas in the shortest possible term. Over the last five years, the Ukrainian government has tried to achieve the complete ceasefire via negotiations in the Minsk and Normandy formats. Ukraine has also proposed to send peacekeeping forces to Donbas.
On 13 October 2019, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy underlined that “ending the war in Donbas” was a priority for the Ukrainian government.
Moreover, recently Ukraine has fulfilled all preparatory steps, such as the withdrawal of troops on three sites, necessary to hold the meeting in the “Normandy format”, scheduled for 9 December 2019.",REAL
734,THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND IN AFGHANISTAN FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATTERN: THE WEST IGNORES RUSSIAN OR SOVIET INTERESTS,"SUMMARY
The war in Ukraine and in Afghanistan follow a similar pattern: The West ignores Russian or Soviet interests directly in the country’s neighbourhood.
The conflict over Ukraine and Crimea for more than five years seems to follow a similar pattern to that over Afghanistan 40 years ago: Western activities deliberately ignore Soviet or Russian interests directly in the country’s neighbourhood. When Moscow can no longer ignore this, and reacts to it, it is accused of exactly that, in both cases first and foremost by the USA. This is followed by one-sided blame, distraction from one’s own role and interests, and sanctions.
[Context: The conflict over Crimea was a consequence of the coup in Kyiv in February 2014.]
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Western belligerence towards Russia, Western attempts to encircle Russia, its involvement in the war in Ukraine, stating that the 2013-2014 Euromaidan protests resulted in an illegal coup; painting Ukraine and other states as failing states incapable of making its own policy choices and painting the West as the puppet-master of their politics.
The Euromaidan was not organised by the West but was the sovereign choice of Ukrainians for pro-European development. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. There was no coup d'état in Ukraine.
After Yanukovych’s escape from Ukraine in 2014, Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula. Also, the war in Eastern Ukraine is a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014.
In late December 1979 Soviet troops invaded in Afghanistan after staging a coup against the incumbent President, Hafizulla Amin. The Soviet Union intervened in support of the Afghan communist government in its conflict with anticommunist Muslim guerrillas during the Afghan War (1978–92) and remained in Afghanistan until mid-February 1989. The war in Afghanistan became a quagmire for what by the late 1980s was the disintegrating Soviet Union. The Soviets suffered some 15,000 dead and many more injured; around 2 million Afghan civilians were killed during the war.  In 1988 the United States, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union signed an agreement by which the latter would withdraw its troops from the country.",REAL
735,"FINLAND PROVOKED THE WAR AGAINST SOVIET UNION IN 1939, SOVIET LEADERSHIP STATED","SUMMARY
On 26th November, 1939 at 15 hours 45 minutes, Soviet troops located near the village Mainila, at the border with Finland were unexpectedly fired by [Finnish] artillery fire. A total of seven shots were fired. As a result, three soldiers and one junior commander were killed. Seven soldiers and two commanders were injured. The Soviet government informed the Finnish side with a note. Finland answered with their own note and stated that the fire originated in the Soviet territory – Finnish boarder guards did not possess the weapons to do that. Moscow was not satisfied and called its diplomats from Finland.
In the morning November 30 the Red Army crossed the Finnish border. The war started.
DISPROOF
It is an undisputed historical fact that the shelling of Mainila was a false flag operation by the Soviet Union. It gave the USSR a pretext to launch the Winter War.
Later, Russia has admitted setting up the incident.
At a meeting with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari in Moscow in 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that the seizure of Finnish territory was an example of Stalin’s totalitarian and aggressive politics.

736,ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS – NOOSE IN THE HANDS OF THE WEST,"SUMMARY
The issue of environmental problems has long become a noose in the hands of the West to hinder the development of dangerous competitors. Thus, a very trendy emphasis on ecology is just speculation.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory without any evidence, Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the West exploiting the environmental agenda and climate change topic to do harm to Russia, and that global warming is a ""hoax"" perpetrated by special interest groups like green businesses that stand to benefit from the climate hysteria.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Russia has to carry a heavy burden associated with the implementation of the Paris Agreement, that the West believes that as a result of global warming, only Russia will benefit, that the West's anti-family strategy is part of the war for Big Russia resources and that the climate mafia is exploiting Greta Thunberg to lower living standards.",REAL
737,THE WEST IS USING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AS A NOOSE AGAINST COMPETITORS,"SUMMARY
Environmental issues have long turned into a noose, used by the West to restrain the development of dangerous competitors by convincing them that the intensive economy is very bad.
At the international level, the West is trying to impose onerous restrictions on other economies. Or they are trying to tarnish the reputation of certain economic products and to squeeze out a rapidly growing competitor from the market.
This global environmental propaganda successfully shapes public opinion in the direction it needs.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin conspiracy theory about the West allegedly exploiting the environmental agenda and climate change topic for self-serving reasons and using it as an imperialist tool against other countries.
Climate change is a scientific fact. Humans are increasingly influencing the climate and the earth's temperature by burning fossil fuels, cutting down rain-forests and farming livestock. This adds enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and global warming. Preventing dangerous consequences of the climate change is the  key priority for the EU.

739,OPCW FALSIFIED AND MANIPULATED DOUMA EVIDENCE TO BLAME THE ASSAD GOVERNMENT,"SUMMARY
An internal OPCW (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) e-mail message sent by an OPCW inspector reveals that the organisation’s management falsified and manipulated the evidence gathered by the organisation’s inspectors sent to Douma in order to blame the Assad government for the alleged chemical attack in Douma on 7 April 2018, and to justify the military raids on Syria launched afterwards by the US, France and the UK.
The email message confirms that the final OPCW report, issued in March 2019, was based on the manipulation of evidence gathered by the FFM, falsely accused the Assad government for the Douma attack, and provided the indispensable justification for the US, UK and French bombings and missile attacks against Syria.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative seeking to absolve the Assad regime of responsibility for chemical attacks perpetrated in the course of the Syrian civil war, as well as to undermine the credibility and independence of the OPCW. Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative claiming that the Douma chemical attacks were staged by Western actors in order to justify military action against the Assad regime.
The internal OPCW e-mail message published by Wikileaks, sent on June 22 2018 by an unidentified member of OPCW’s Fact Finding Mission (FFM), does not accuse the OPCW management of deliberately manipulating and suppressing evidence gathered by the FFM in order to blame the Assad government for the Douma attack and to justify Western military intervention against Syria.
For example, the management's draft said that chlorine or another reactive chlorine-containing chemical was ""likely"" to have been released from two cylinders found at the scene. The email argues, instead, that while the cylinders might have been the sources of the suspected chemical there was ""insufficient evidence to affirm this"".
The e-mail message actually refers to a draft OPCW  interim report, not to the final report published in March 2019. The interim report published in July 2018 was basically a progress report which described the FFM’s activities until that date. The final OPCW report actually accepts the points made by the FFM member in the internal e-mail.

740,WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY DOESN’T HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE DECISIONS AFFECTING RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
It is necessary to emphasise that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) does not make decisions in relation to Russian sports, it offers them. The end point will be the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) process. A number of sanctions offered by WADA are mainly directed against representatives of Russian state authorities, against state symbols, while part of the WADA does not have any authority to make any decisions that affect Russia or its representatives.
DISPROOF
One of the methods of Kremlin disinformation is to deny the authority of international organisations and independent agencies to regulate and implement sanctions that impact it. The topic of doping is also a popular one in Russian media outlets. See examples such as  ""The exclusion of Russian athletes in the Olympics is a form of war"" and ""There is no evidence that Russian athletes have been using doping"".
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was established in 1999 as an international independent agency composed and funded equally by the sport movement and governments around the world. Its key purpose is to carry out the World Anti-Doping Code (Code) – the document harmonising anti-doping policies in all sports and in all countries.
WADA reports cases of non-compliance to its stakeholders who have jurisdiction to impose sanctions, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Olympic charter was amended in 2003 to state that the adoption of the Code by the Olympic movement is mandatory. Only sports that adopt and implement the Code can be included and remain in the programme of the Olympic Games. If a country does not ratify the International Convention against Doping in Sport, it may be subject to sanctions from the IOC and from other sports organisations, including losing the right to host the Olympic Games.
In Russia, the following organisations have accepted the WADA Code: Russian Olympic Committee, Russian Anti-Doping Agency 'RUSADA' and the Paralympic Committee.
On November 25, 2019, WADA said its independent Compliance Review Committee (CRC) was recommending that RUSADA be declared non-compliant with the Code. Russia’s handling of WADA’s requests during the investigation of doping violations is “an extremely serious case of non-compliance” with several “aggravating features,” WADA stated.
The measures the CRC proposed in its recommendations to the WADA Executive Committee (ExCo) are pending a final decision on December 9, 2019.",REAL
741,THE ANGLO-SAXONS ARE INSTIGATING GLOBAL CONFLICTS TO AVOID AN ECONOMIC CRISIS FOR THEMSELVES,"SUMMARY
Large financiers and central banks are preparing for a new global economic crisis and a possible global war. An expected big crisis is also increasing chances of regional and even global conflicts as the Anglo-Saxon elites will try to use them as a tool of delaying the crisis for themselves and opening new markets through conquering ‘non-democratic states’ and looting their resources.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given. This disinformation message promotes the concept of big conspiracy and is consistent with the recurring Shadow Government narrative, which pro-Kremlin disinformation sources often deploy as a rhetorical device to undermine the West and the international liberal-democratic institutional order.
For example, see earlier disinformation cases alleging that global neo-colonialists stage colour revolutions and conquer indigenous national elites, that Western leaders are merely marionettes of the shadow rulers, and that the Anglo-Saxons rule America “from abroad” and are now trying to control Russia.",REAL
742,"THE PROTESTERS WANT HONG KONG TO BECOME A US COLONY

Despite the overwhelming pro-democracy vote on 24 November 2019, protests continue. They were waving US flags, chanting the Star-Spangled Banner and are asking for more support. They pledge not to let go until all their demands are met. Essentially, they want total independence from Beijing and become a US colony.
DISPROOF
This is conspiracy theory consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the US or West funding the Hong Kong protests.
Pro-Kremlin media have long used the disinformation narrative, applied in a wide range of contexts, that any anti-government protests are funded by the US and do not emerge organically. Examples include colour revolutions in post-Soviet states, the “Arab Spring” revolts, and Ukraine's Euromaidan in 2014. Western NGOs are often targeted by pro-Kremlin disinformation as agents of this subversive and state-driven influence.

743,GRETA THUNBERG DECLARED WAR AGAINST WHITE MEN,"SUMMARY
The “green madness” spanning the western world is already leading to serious economic repercussions.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greta Thunberg are against the so-called “patriarchal system of oppression” and urge to refrain from having children. They also declare that it is the locals’ racism that makes migrants to commit crimes.

745,NETHERLANDS MH17 HYSTERIA DEMONSTRATES DUTCH GOVERNMENT COMPLICITY IN THE TRAGEDY,"SUMMARY
The Dutch government, as a agent of the Euro-Atlantic establishment, has lost all links to the reality and is not even pretending that it cares about the human rights and the objective investigation; Representatives of the European elite involved in covering up the truth behind the MH17 crash are panicking because the mainstream ‘Russia is guilty’ narrative has collapsed.
Dutch government tried to pay a bribe to Tsemakh for his loyality and participation in the MH17 farce by proposing him to move to the Netherlands.
Under international law (as well as laws of a majority of the states), the concealment of facts related to the crime is a signal of complicity in the crime. The Dutch government, which is allegedly a neutral side in the MH17 case, is de-facto impeding the objective investigation of the tragedy.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Joint International Investigation and the downing of the flight MH17. 
The disinformation message appeared after the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service claimed that Russia willingly allowed Mr Tsemakh, a suspect in the MH17 case, to leave the Russian Federation and refused to execute the Dutch request for extradition. Read more here. Ukraine has also issued the warrant for Volodymyr Tsemakh.
A special team, known as the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.  On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT  the Dutch Public Persecution service will persecute 4 individuals for causing the crash of the MH17 and murdering of 289 persons on board.
The JIT has launched an appeal for witnesses who might have more information about the persons involved in the downing of the MH17. Every witness who comes forward maybe offered a witness safety and protection program. If necessary the program can protect witness identities and may include the use of assumed identities and may include re-location and in some cases permanent re-settling in another country.

746,JEWS DISTORT AMERICAN POLITICS,"SUMMARY
Zionist Jews have distorted American politics since the time of President Harry S. Truman. President after president has backed down versus Israel when confronted by Jewish power. […] Jews are essentially able to shut down any discussion of Palestine or of Palestinian rights. Given the extreme over-representation of Jews in both the news generation process and in various choke points in the political process, an honest discussion of Israel-Palestine and the actual U.S. interests in the region is extremely difficult to find anywhere in the mainstream media. […]
Beyond all that, if one doubts the power of the Jewish/Israel lobby internationally, note one of the first actions undertaken by the new coup government in Bolivia. It has moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with Israel as a top priority. Brazil also sought a closer relationship with Israel after conservative Jair Bolsonaro was elected president and pledged to visit the Jewish state, a promise which he carried out in March. Everyone in the world understands that the way to gain favor with Washington is to go through Israel.
DISPROOF
This case propagates an old anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that is frequently invoked in pro-Kremlin disinformation: that the Jewish people are an international cabal secretly controlling or poisoning the global ""elite""; in this particular case, the media and national governments.

747,THE US HAS NO CONCERN FOR HUMAN RIGHTS,"SUMMARY
No reasonable person can claim today that the US has any concern for human rights. Except for Israel, the US has by far the worst record of human rights violations during the past several hundred years, far outstripping anything attributed to people like Stalin or Hitler, or even the Japanese.
DISPROOF
This is yet another example of one of the most common pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives - the ""Evil West"" - according to which alleged Western imperialism and meddling around the world is presented as the most malicious and destructive force in the world. Specifically, it follows the recurring pro-Kremlin tendency to demonise the United States, grossly misrepresenting historical facts in the process.
While it is true that the US has a controversial human rights record and is currently seeing declining performance on human rights protections, it is misleading to say that the US has no concern for human rights. The US continues to score highly on freedom indicators, political rights, and civil liberties. The Constitution of the United States - the foundational document of American democracy - enshrines a number of inalienable human rights, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the right to keep and bear arms, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to a fair trial by jury. Additional human rights have been recognised in amendments to the Constitution, as well as acts by Congress.
No evidence is given to support the claim the US human rights violations exceed those of of Stalin and Hitler. Both the Soviet Union under Stalin and Nazi Germany under Hitler committed crimes against humanity and were responsible for the mass murder of civilians: according to the estimate of historians, like Timothy Snyder, the number of victims of repressions under Stalin accounts for 20 million plus deaths and under Hitler for approximately 11 million.

Private investors are not willing to take part in large infrastructure projects as Poland has a bad investment climate. According to the ”Doing Business” ranking, Poland occupies only 76th place in this list of countries attractive for business.
DISPROOF
This narrative is focused on the spread of disinformation on economic problems and the failure of market reforms in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
The 2020 “Doing Business” report prepared by the World Bank puts Poland on the 40th place in its ranking, among such countries as Portugal (39), Czechia (41) and the Netherlands (42). During the recent decade, Poland has visibly improved its position in the ranking, moving from the 72nd place in 2010 to the 32nd place in 2015 and the 24th place in 2017.
During the last two decades, Poland has become one of the most dynamic economies in Europe. It enjoys uninterrupted economic growth since the early 1990s, with an average GDP growth of 4.2% a year, doubling its GDP between 1990 and 2015. This growth allowed Poland to narrow the economic gap to the most developed EU countries – the Polish GDP (at PPP) has increased from 32% to 60% of the Western European average (EU-15).

757,PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT WAS SABOTAGING PRISONER EXCHANGES IN DONBAS DUE TO ANTI-RUSSIAN HYSTERIA AND RUSSOPHOBIA,"SUMMARY
If there was a clear decision to exchange all prisoners, then it could be implemented. It will take a short period of time. This could have been done under Poroshenko, but he didn’t want it, intentionally, because he didn’t need any territory or these people, he needed a policy of anti-Russian hysteria and Russophobia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the War in Ukraine and the Minsk agreements.
In the last five years, numerous talks on the exchange of the prisoners have been held in the Minsk format (in the Trilateral Contact Group). As a result, hundreds of prisoners have been exchanged during 2014-2017. In general, 4 prisoner swaps have taken place: on 26-27 December 2014, 26-27 August 2015, 2 August 2017, and 27 December 2017.
Recently, on 7 September 2019, another exchange took place when both Ukraine and Russia released 35 prisoners. President Zelenskyy has also mentioned that the prisoner exchange is one of the major topics to be discussed during the meeting on 9 December 2019 in France in the Normandy Format.

758,PRO-WESTERN BELARUSIAN OPPOSITION PREPARES A REVOLUTION WITH ASSISTANCE OF ARMED UKRAINIAN NATIONALISTS,"SUMMARY
The Belarusian opposition is planning a revolution, pro-Western forces stand behind the protests. The Belarusian authorities have to act decisively, and they should have done this immediately after protests against the Union State between Belarus and Russia started. In contrast to the opposition’s will, the integration process with Russia should be accelerated. Belarus should also adopt Russian experience on combatting nationalists. If all these measures are taken, then the Belarusian presidential elections will be smooth, without involving armed Ukrainian nationalists. Belarus should also not allow the opposition to organise mass demonstrations, otherwise it will attract the attention of the international community and provoke a conflict. Finally, the Belarusian authorities should not play with those Europeans who support the Belarusian opposition. The blogger NEXTA, Andrei Sannikau and other opposition activists should be extradited to Belarus and recognised as enemies of the people.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy and contains ungrounded claims about the plans to stage an armed revolution, aimed to discredit the democratic Belarusian opposition, the West, and any actors which oppose deeper integration within the Union State between Belarus and Russia. This disinformation message is a modification of a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about Western attempts to organise a colour revolution in Belarus and to disrupt Belarusian-Russian relations.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that Belarusian opposition leader Andrei Sannikau prepares a coup with US military assistance, that the West has again ordered Belarusian opposition to take over power by force, that the Belarusian opposition, civic activists and independent journalists make kill lists for Western security bodies, and that the West's only interest in Belarus is to make it anti-Russian.",REAL
759,MILITANTS WITH THE HELP OF WHITE HELMETS ARE PLANNING NEW PROVOCATIONS IN SYRIA,"SUMMARY
Terrorist groups are planning provocations in Syrian Idlib with White Helmets. Terrorists are going to stage airstrikes and chemical attacks on the territories of the de-escalation zone. Also, militants are already conducting a “casting” among local residents to participate in the filming.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin conspiracy theory painting the White Helmets as terrorists and shifting blame for chemical attacks in Syria away from the Assad regime.
The White Helmets are a staple topic of pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on the Syrian civil war, having already been accused of numerous other provocations and war crimes including organ trafficking; aiding terrorist organizations; staging and/or perpetrating chemical attacks, sometimes with the help of Western intelligence agencies. These claims are not supported by evidence.
Notwithstanding the Kremlin's repeated ""warnings"" of imminent chemical attacks (real or staged) to be carried out by Western actors, available evidence stubbornly continues to link such incidents to the Syrian regime. By September 2018, UN human rights investigators had identified 39 chemical attacks perpetrated in Syria since 2013, of which 33 were attributed to Damascus.
See similar cases claiming that  White Helmets and terrorists are jointly preparing new chemical provocations in Syria and that White Helmets are involved in the production of videos of staged chemical attacks.

760,CRIMEA REGAINED ITS RUSSIAN IDENTITY,"SUMMARY
Crimea regained Russian identity in 2014. Previously, since the early 1950s, it was under the administration of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine, one of the republics of the Soviet Union.
DISPROOF
Recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on Crimea being a historical part of Russia.
After the collapse of the USSR, Russia reaffirmed respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. In particular, the 1997 Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine enshrines the recognition of the inviolability of each other’s borders, the absence of discrimination against representatives of each nationality and the desire for cooperation in various fields. The Treaty also allowed Russia to keep its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, under a lease that has been extended until 2042.
In January 2019, the Ukrainian Embassy in France published an open letter declaring that saying that Crimea is Russian ""for centuries"" is, to say the least, excessive. Crimea was annexed in 1783, already in violation of a treaty which guaranteed the independence of the Tatar khanate. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the peninsula was a territory in the process of colonization. In 1897, the first comprehensive census of the population of the empire indicated that the Russians are only one-third of the inhabitants of Crimea, where they are still slightly fewer than the Tatars. The Russians only became a majority after the complete deportation in 1944 of the Tatars, who could only return after the fall of the communist regime. The annexation of Crimea to the then Soviet Ukraine, in 1954, was done not on an ethnic, but geographical and economic basis. But what is more important today than the circumstances of 1954 and even more so of 1854 is that the borders of Ukraine, including Crimea, were recognized and guaranteed after its independence in 1991 by international agreements, some of which were signed by Russia itself.
According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Russia violated international law as well as key principles of the European security framework by illegally annexing the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol in 2014.",REAL

762,EUROPE IS ENGULFED BY SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Major European countries are overwhelmed by sanctions against Russia […]. Nearly half of the losses caused by sanctions against Russia are incurred by Western countries. 
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that Western sanctions against Russia are ineffective and/or meaningless.
In fact, the sanctions from the US and the EU do not aim to punish Russia or the Russian people but were introduced to send a clear signal to the Russian government after Russia's illegal annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula and the downing of the Malaysian passenger plane MH17.
Claims that the sanctions are ineffective are not backed by evidence. In reality, most research supports the view that sanctions, imposed on Russia by the US and EU following the annexation of Crimea and Russian meddling in the US election, have worked as planned, noting the drag they have imposed on Russia’s general economic development since 2014: ""This adverse effect most likely operates by depressing both foreign trade and foreign capital flows into Russia. Russia’s own counter-sanctions have also had a clear negative effect on the welfare of the average Russian household.""
According to the report of the European Parliament, the decline of EU trade with Russia after 2013 can be attributed to a number of factors, most importantly the slump in international oil price which damaged Russian economy and devaluated the ruble.
In 2014 Russian GDP growth was as low as 0.7%. It decreased by 2,3% in 2015 and had modest revival afterwards with 0.3%, 1.6%, and 2.3% of growth during 2016-2018, the World Bank data shows. In contrast to Russia, during the same period, the EU's economy did not experience recessions and had annual GDP growth between 1.8% and 2.5%.
The GDP forecast for the EU stands at 1.4% in 2019, while the Russian economy has forecasted growth of 1.2% in 2019, World Bank said in its Russia Economic Report. The cumulated export loss to Russia during 2014-2018 is estimated at EUR 30 billion (about -0.2% of EU’s GDP in 2018), incurred largely during 2014-2016, as EU exports to Russia recovered in 2017.
The latest decision on a six-month extension of EU sanctions against Russian was taken on the 12th of September 2019, lasting until March 2020.",REAL

DISPROOF
No supportive evidence is given to this recurrent conspiracy narrative on the coup in Ukraine in 2014, fomented by the West, Georges Soros or Victoria Nuland in person, often also portrayed as a ""Nazi coup"".
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was the people's reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Victor Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.

764,"CHEMICAL ATTACK IN DOUMA FABRICATED BY THE WHITE HELMETS
","SUMMARY
The alleged fabricated chemical attack in Douma, Syria, was made by the so-called “White Helmets” group, that two of their previous affiliates, who refused to be made public, confirmed their leaders are directly linked to the “Army of Islam” and other terrorist groups that controlled the city at the time.
There is also the need to reveal the fate of the victims of the alleged incident.
DISPROOF
No reliable evidence that footage of people being treated in a hospital after the chemical weapons attack in Douma was fake.
Recurring disinformation narratives deflecting blame for chemical attacks from the Assad regime; painting the White Helmets as terrorists.
It is also consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that chemical attack in Douma, Syria was staged. See our and Bellingcat's reporting how Russian and Syrian state media have used fiction movies to ""prove"" that the Douma attack was fabricated.
The Report of the OPCW fact-finding mission in Syria regarding the incident of alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Douma states that ""Based on the levels of chlorinated organic derivatives, detected in several environmental samples gathered at the sites of alleged use of toxic chemicals (Locations 2 and 4), which are not naturally present in the environment, the FFM concludes that the objects from which the samples were taken at both locations had been in contact with one or more substances containing reactive chlorine.""
According to the World Health Organisation, during the shelling of Douma, an estimated 500 patients presented to health facilities exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals.
Since the outbreak of the Syrian war in 2011, Russia has vetoed a dozen UN Security Council resolutions concerning Syria, of which six called for the launch or renewal of joint enquiries into chemical attacks in the country. More recently, the Syrian government denied entry to a senior OPCW investigator and head of the Investigation and Identification Team, arguing that it ""does not recognise"" the newly established unit.
Furthermore, the bodies were buried in unmarked graves in an attempt ""to preserve what could become the most important evidence"" from the night of 7 April 2018.",REAL
765,THE LIST OF THOSE KILLED ON THE MAIDAN HAS A VERY WEAK CONNECTION WITH REALITY,"SUMMARY
The list of those killed on Maidan in February 2014 has a very weak connection with reality. People who were not killed at the Maidan were still awarded the title ‘Hero of Ukraine’.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory perpetuating pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the Euromaidan protests. Such statements are another attempt to discredit Euromaidan and those who died during the protests in 2013-2014.
The list of the Heavenly Hundred contains 130 identified deaths on both sides of the conflict. The majority of those listed were civilian protesters who supported the revolution; 18 police officers who were killed by the protesters are also included. The stories of the victims and the causes of their death are covered in different investigations and dedicated websites.
The numerous articles promoted by the Russian media quote Elena Lukash, who in 2013 was the Minister of Justice of Ukraine under President Yanukovych. Lukash refers to anonymous sources in her accusations that the ""list of those killed has a weak connection to reality"", however, she herself is wanted for committing crimes against the Maidan protestors as well as ""official forgery"" and has been placed on the EU sanctions list. It's easy to compare information provided by Lukash and information that was collected by journalists and human rights defenders to see the many inconsistencies.
For example, Olga Buru who Lukash claims “suffered from a number of serious diseases that caused the activist’s death and not the events on the Maidan”. According to Radio Liberty, Olga injured her hand when she was laying paving stones for the construction of barricades. An infection got into the wound and after a while, the hand began to throb and hurt. At the hospital, she was injected with drugs that her body didn't accept and convulsions started. She died March 10, 2014, from injuries sustained during the events on the Maidan and therefore is on the list of the “Heavenly Hundred”.
The other evidence of falsification that Russian media used is that not all of the “Heavenly Hundred” were killed on February 20, 2014, at Institutskaya Street. However, all activists who died because of the events on Euromaidan were included in the list, no matter the date of death.
Russian media use the example of Vasiliy Aksenin, who died on March 11 “in Poland, because of a medical error”. In fact, snipers shot at Vasiliy Aksenin on February 20 at Institutskaya Street, and he died after complex operations and treatment in Poland.

771,THE LIST OF THOSE KILLED ON THE MAIDAN HAS A VERY WEAK CONNECTION WITH REALITY,"SUMMARY
The list of those killed on Maidan in February 2014 has a very weak connection with reality. People who were not killed at the Maidan were still awarded the title ‘Hero of Ukraine’.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory perpetuating pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the Euromaidan protests. Such statements are another attempt to discredit Euromaidan and those who died during the protests in 2013-2014.
The list of the Heavenly Hundred contains 130 identified deaths on both sides of the conflict. The majority of those listed were civilian protesters who supported the revolution; 18 police officers who were killed by the protesters are also included. The stories of the victims and the causes of their death are covered in different investigations and dedicated websites.
The numerous articles promoted by the Russian media quote Elena Lukash, who in 2013 was the Minister of Justice of Ukraine under President Yanukovych. Lukash refers to anonymous sources in her accusations that the ""list of those killed has a weak connection to reality"", however, she herself is wanted for committing crimes against the Maidan protestors as well as ""official forgery"" and has been placed on the EU sanctions list. It's easy to compare information provided by Lukash and information that was collected by journalists and human rights defenders to see the many inconsistencies.
For example, Olga Buru who Lukash claims “suffered from a number of serious diseases that caused the activist’s death and not the events on the Maidan”. According to Radio Liberty, Olga injured her hand when she was laying paving stones for the construction of barricades. An infection got into the wound and after a while, the hand began to throb and hurt. At the hospital, she was injected with drugs that her body didn't accept and convulsions started. She died March 10, 2014, from injuries sustained during the events on the Maidan and therefore is on the list of the “Heavenly Hundred”.

774,"THE US PROMISED THE WHOLE WORLD THAT NATO WILL NOT MOVE ONE INCH TO THE EAST
","SUMMARY
30 years ago, US Secretary of State James Baker promised the whole world – if Mikhail Gorbachev agrees to unite Germany, NATO will not move one inch to the East.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the West encircling Russia via NATO and NATO enlargement.
This promise was never made, as Mikhail Gorbachev, then-president of the Soviet Union has himself confirmed.
Central and Eastern European countries began seeking NATO membership in the early 1990s. NATO actively sought to create a cooperative environment that was conducive to enlargement while simultaneously building special relations with Russia.
NATO does not ""expand"" in the imperialistic sense described by pro-Kremlin media. Rather, it considers the applications of candidate countries who want to join the alliance on their own national will. As such, NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. NATO's ""Open Door Policy"" is based on Article 10 of the Alliance's founding document, the North Atlantic Treaty (1949). The Treaty states that NATO membership is open to any ""European state in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area"". Every sovereign nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security and one to which Russia has also subscribed.",REAL

Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative claiming that Ukrainian ships aggressively violated Russian borders in 2018 and that it was a provocation of the fifth president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko.
There is no official representation of annexed Crimea in Brussels.

779,EUROPE IS LOSING ITS VALUES AND FORMER POWER,"SUMMARY
There were times when European countries were developing very quickly, both economically and culturally, but now Europe is losing its values and former power.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative undermining the EU, claiming that the EU is fundamentally broken and disintegrating - also consistent with the narrative of the EU's imminent collapse.
No evidence is given to support the claim that Europe is losing its values and former power.
The European Parliament’s Spring 2019 Eurobarometer, measuring public attitudes to the EU three months ahead of the European elections, reveals that despite the various internal and external challenges to the EU of the past years, the European sense of togetherness does not seem to have weakened. Continued support for EU membership goes with a strong belief (68%) that EU countries overall have benefited from being part of the EU - equalling the highest level recorded since 1983. In addition, 61% of respondents say their country’s EU membership is a good thing.
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the European Union expanded 1.30 percent in the third quarter of 2019 compared with the same quarter of the previous year. 
In addition, the latest EU public opinion survey, conducted in February 2019, highlights continued strong support for the European Union.

780,CRIMEA AND SEVASTOPOL ARE IRREVERSIBLY RUSSIAN,"SUMMARY
Crimea became part of Russia again after the March 2014 referendum, with 96.77 percent of voters in the Republic of Crimea and 95.6 percent of Sevastopol’s people voting in favour of joining Russia. This was after the overthrow of the regime in Ukraine in February 2014.
The Russian leadership has stated many times that the people of Crimea have expressed their desire to rejoin Russia, in a democratic process that fully complies with the requirements of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. According to President Vladimir Putin, the Crimea issue is complete and irreversibly closed.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about Crimea and Sevastopol.
Crimea is part of Ukraine that was illegally annexed by Russia. Following the covert invasion by “little green men”, the referendum in Crimea was conducted hastily and at gunpoint, barring impartial observers from entering the peninsula. Therefore, no international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014.
On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.""
A year later, even the Kremlin admitted that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum.
The European Union does not recognise the illegal annexation of Crimea and continues to condemn this violation of international law, and states that Russia’s illegal actions remain a direct challenge to international security, with grave implications for the international legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all States.",REAL
781,THE UN RECOGNISES THE RUSSIAN CRIMEA,"SUMMARY
The member of the Russian delegation to the UN, representing Crimea, was officially accredited to participate in the UN Minority Forum. Thus, the UN recognises the Russian Crimea.
DISPROOF
The disinformation narrative about the annexation of Crimea by Russia and its progressive recognition in the world is recurrent. No international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014 amid the presence of Russian troops. The UNGA adopted resolution 68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine. For the EU's statement on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, see here.
Member of the delegation of the pro-Russian representatives of the annexed Crimea, the State Duma deputy Ruslan Balbek, spoke in Geneva on November 29 at the 12th session of the Minority Forum of the UN Human Rights Council. However, it doesn't confirm that the UN recognises the Russian Crimea.
Ukrainian delegation in the UNMF stated that ""the Russian Federation continues to use all possible procedural barriers to circumvent the UN resolutions, which directly and unequivocally affirm the illegality of Russia's occupation of the Ukrainian Crimea, and at least try to ""illuminate"" any collaborators in the Crimea as representatives of the Russian Federation, and thus try to legitimise their crime of occupying part of the territory of Ukraine.""
It was also confirmed that the co-chairmen of the Forum acknowledged that this position had been communicated very clearly and assured that it would be properly reflected in the official reports.

785,US BIOLOGICAL LABORATORIES WERE EXPOSED IN GEORGIA AND THE BALTIC,"SUMMARY
About a year ago, the US biological laboratories were exposed in Georgia and the Baltic States, where they modify viruses and many serious diseases.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory with no evidence given, based on recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the biological weapons.
See similar disinformation cases: the US prepares biological weapons against Russia, the US is constructing secret biological labs, Pentagon is working out a biological war strategy in the Baltics.
Sputnik's claims that the Lugar Center and other biological labs in the Caucasus and Central Asia are making banned bioweapons are unfounded. Last month a group of international experts visited the Lugar Center in Georgia, and given access to all areas of the site, examined relevant documentation, and interviewed staff, and concluded that the Center demonstrates significant transparency. The group observed nothing out of the ordinary, or that someone wouldn’t expect to see in a legitimate facility of this sort.
Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research is a facility of the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC), which became operational in August 2013. The Lugar centre is a top-tiered institution in NCDC’s laboratory network and serves as a reference laboratory of Georgia’s public health system.
Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon strongly rejected the claims, calling them “an invention of the imaginative and false Russian disinformation campaign against the West” and “obvious attempts to divert attention from Russia’s bad behaviour on many fronts.”

786,JIT CHOSE TO IGNORE RUSSIAN EVIDENCE OF THE MH17 CRASH,"SUMMARY
Russian Deputy Prosecutor-General Nikolai Vinichenko stated that the Russian side provided all Russian radar data to the Netherlands, with documents indicating that the BUK missile system that hit the (Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777) was Ukrainian, but this information was ignored by investigators.
Accusations by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) into Russia’s involvement in the Malaysian Boeing crash are groundless.
DISPROOF
The report advances recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the MH17 crash.
First of all, Russia's interest in aiding the JIT investigation is not a relevant condition of its membership in JIT. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke told a Russian newspaper that ""if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.""
Secondly, the ""evidence"" claimed by Russia, namely radar data and the ""field experiment"" conducted by the Russian military company Almaz-Antey, is only a small sample of misleading claims advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have contradicted one another.
The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. On 24 May 2018, JIT stated that the BUK-TELAR that was used to down MH17 originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation. The JIT reached this conclusion after extensive comparative research. See another detailed debunk of this claim here.
On the basis of the investigation conducted by the JIT, with the participation of law enforcement agencies from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, Ukraine and the Netherlands, the Dutch Public Persecution service will prosecute Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, Sergey Nikolayevich Dubinskiy, Oleg Yuldashevich Pulatov and Leonid Volodymyrovych Kharchenko for causing the MH17 crash and murdering all 298 persons on board. The Public Prosecution Service alleges that the four individuals cooperated to obtain and deploy the BUK TELAR at the firing location with the aim of shooting down an aircraft. For that reason, they can also be held jointly accountable for downing flight MH17.
The JIT conclusions were further corroborated by the Bellingcat Investigation Team. For the full Bellingcat report see here.",REAL

No international body has recognised the so-called referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.""

On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
The EU's policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity. In March 2019 on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.

788,"THE ONLY THING WHICH KEEPS THE MEMBERS OF NATO UNITED IS “RUSSOPHOBIA”
","SUMMARY
The only thing which keeps the members of NATO united is “Russophobia” and hostility towards Russia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Russophobia. It groundlessly alleges that NATO countries are kept together only thanks to consolidation around their anti-Russian positions.
NATO was founded in 1949 by twelve sovereign nations: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United States. It has since grown to 29 Allies who each took an individual and sovereign decision to join this Alliance. After the end of the Cold War until the 2014 Ukraine crisis, most US and Western policymakers no longer viewed Russia as an adversary, instead, taking the opinion that it could potentially become, or already was, a credible and responsible partner for Western states.
Read earlier disinformation cases alleging that the US and EU countries are Russophobic, that anti-Russian position helped NATO countries freeze a drift in different directions and that Russian threat is an invention.

789,THE US GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO ERADICATE CHRISTIANITY,"SUMMARY
The U.S. Government is most willing to utilize “religion” for the propagation of its agenda. It is not at all anti-religious, it is, although, completely anti-christian [sic]. A new global mind and narrative must emerge. For this to happen the “old” mind must be eradicated – Christianity, specifically Orthodoxy.
So it is not surprising at all when tremors begin to emerge that Joe Biden and others in the US government are at current [sic] putting pressure on the Patriarch of Jerusalem to recognize the false and schismatic group in Ukraine. The schismatic group in Ukraine is but one example of the current global power’s willingness to utilize “religion/church” as a tool for its goals.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given. This claim involves the recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that the West threatens and undermines traditional Christian values. More specifically, it attempts to delegitimise the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - one of the pro-Kremlin media's ongoing disinformation campaigns against Ukraine - by claiming that the US inappropriately sought to influence the process.
In fact, the process of recognition was initiated by the Orthodox Church of Greece on 8 January 2019, when the Permanent Synod of the Church of Greece decided that the issue of recognition would be dealt by the Synod of the Hierarchy of the Church of Greece. In February, the Synod of the Church decided to appoint two commissions to study the issue. In August, the commissions presented a report and recommended to recognise the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. On 12 October, the primate of the church Ieronymos II of Athens and other hierarchs supported the conclusions and voted for the recognition, stating that “the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has the right to granting autocephaly”.

796,NATO LIQUIDATES SOVEREIGN STATES,"SUMMARY
NATO does not deserve the Czech Republic’s 2% [of the GDP]. Czech defence spending should not serve the expansionary pan-world efforts of the United States, as has unfortunately been the case so far. It would be extremely sad if Czech taxpayers’ money should be used to further liquidate sovereign nation states, to promote the interests of multinational corporations, and last but not least, to initiate wars over natural resources.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about NATO acting as an aggressor and being a threat to global security and stability. In addition, it also promotes the common disinformation narrative that the US - in this case via NATO - is seeking ""imperialistic"" control over Europe and undermining the sovereignty of other countries.
NATO is a defensive alliance whose purpose is to protect its member states. Every country that joins NATO undertakes to uphold its principles and policies, and this includes the commitment that ""the Alliance does not seek confrontation"". NATO fully supports the sovereignty of nation states as defined by international law.
Moreover, NATO decisions are made by consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries. This means that when a “NATO decision” is announced, it is the expression of the collective will of all the sovereign states that are members of the Alliance. No single country can determine the course of NATO policy. To read more about disinformation narratives targeting NATO, see here.",REAL
797,"THE COUP PROMPTED CRIMEA TO RESTORE ITS RUSSIA IDENTITY
","SUMMARY
The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv lost control of Crimea and Donbas after the coup in 2014, which prompted the people of Crimea to demand the restoration of Russian identity and return in the arms of Russia while the people of the Donbas region pushed to declare independence from Kyiv by establishing two popular republics in the region.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Euromaidan, the illegal annexation of Crimea, and the war in Ukraine.
There was no coup d'état in Ukraine. The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was an organic reaction by numerous parts of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.
As for Crimea, it did not ""return"" to Russia but was illegally annexed by Moscow. Russia violated international law as well as key principles of the European security framework by illegally annexing the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and deliberate destabilisation of Ukraine, the EU has progressively imposed restrictive measures against Russia.
A year after the illegal annexation, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum.",REAL
798,NATO PROMISED NOT TO EXPAND TO THE EAST,"SUMMARY
After the collapse of the Warsaw bloc, NATO made promises that they would not expand to the East. But this did not happen. And with all the expansion of NATO that took place, they brought the bloc closer to Russia’s borders.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the West encircling Russia via NATO.
NATO Allies take decisions by consensus and these are recorded. There is no record of any such decision having been taken by NATO. Personal assurances from individual leaders cannot replace Alliance consensus and do not constitute formal NATO agreement. This promise was never made, as confirmed by Mikhail Gorbachev, then-president of the Soviet Union.
Central and Eastern European countries began seeking NATO membership in the early 1990s. NATO actively sought to create a cooperative environment that was conducive to enlargement while simultaneously building special relations with Russia.
NATO does not ""expand"" in the imperialistic sense described by pro-Kremlin media. Rather, it considers the applications of candidate countries who want to join the alliance based on their own national will. As such, NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. NATO's ""Open Door Policy"" is based on Article 10 of the Alliance's founding document, the North Atlantic Treaty (1949). The Treaty states that NATO membership is open to any ""European state in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area"". Every sovereign nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security and one to which Russia has also subscribed.",REAL

802,NATO ENLARGEMENT POSES A THREAT TO RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
USSR and Warsaw Pact no longer exist but NATO not only exists but is developing as well. NATO enlargement and development of its infrastructure near Russian borders is one of the potential threats to Russia’s national security. Russia has done everything to cooperate with NATO in order to deal with real problems such as international terrorism, local military conflicts, uncontrolled spread of weapons of mass destruction. But Russia-NATO cooperation was actually cut.
DISPROOF
The statement contains multiple recurring pro-Kremlin narratives on NATO.
The first narrative is NATO as a relic of the Cold War. This narrative aims at undermining NATO's role as a defensive military alliance. Concerning the claim, that NATO is the relic of the Cold War, at the London Summit in 1990, Allied heads of state and government agreed ""to keep standing together, to extend the long peace"". This was their sovereign choice and was fully in line with their right for collective defence. Since then, thirteen more countries have chosen to join NATO. Twice since the end of the Cold War, NATO has adopted new Strategic Concepts (in 1999 and 2010), adapting to new realities. Thus, rather than being disbanded as a relic, NATO adapted, and continues to change, to live up to the needs and expectations of Allies, and to promote their shared vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace. See the identical case about NATO here.
The second narrative claims that NATO poses a threat to Russia. NATO has many time underlined that it is a purely defensive alliance, whose purpose is to protect its member states. In direct response to Russia's use of military force against its neighbours, NATO has deployed four multinational battle-groups to the Baltic States and Poland. These forces are rotational, defensive and proportionate. They cannot compare to the three divisions Russia has established in its Western Military and Southern Military Districts. Before Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, there were no plans to deploy Allied troops to the eastern part of the Alliance. See other cases on NATO posing threat to Russia here, here and here.
The last narrative implies that NATO refused cooperation with Russia. NATO has reached out to Russia consistently, transparently and publicly over the past 29 years. NATO and Russia worked together on issues ranging from counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism to submarine rescue and civil emergency planning. However, in March 2014, in response to Russia's aggressive actions against Ukraine, NATO suspended practical cooperation with Russia.
The NATO - Russia Council is still active.",REAL
803,KYIV PLANNED TO GRANT CRIMEA TO THE US AS A COLONY,"SUMMARY
Kyiv planned to grant Crimea to the US as a colony. The US-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership considered deployment of the US colonial administration in Simferopol in the name of “honourable diplomatic representation”.
DISPROOF
The statement is untrue, there is no evidence to support it. Also consistent with the recurring pro-Kremlin narrative that Ukraine is under the external control of the US.
The US-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership adopted in 2008, considered opening the American diplomatic presence (American Presence Post) in Simferopol. The partnership text also mentioned Crimea as one of the regions of Ukraine and recognized the territorial integrity of Ukraine. American Presence Post is not an imperialist, colonial administration, as presented in the claim, but is a small diplomatic facility also operating in the cities of France, UK and other countries.",REAL
804,GERMANY CREATED THE EURO TO COLONISE COUNTRIES THAT COULDN’T BE CONQUERED MILITARILY,"SUMMARY
German Industrialists created the euro in order to colonize southern Europe. […] this was the plan by some all along, to colonize countries like Greece that couldn’t be conquered militarily in WWII.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory; no evidence given. This is an example of recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation about the euro, attempting to exacerbate divisions within Europe by portraying the eurozone as an imperialistic project of the EU against Member States in order to control them and limit their sovereignty.
The euro was created because a single currency offers many advantages and benefits over the previous situation where each EU Member State had its own currency. Not only are fluctuation risks and exchange costs eliminated and the single market strengthened, but the euro also means closer co-operation among Member States for a stable currency and economy to the benefit of all European citizens. Moreover, public support for the euro is at an all-time high since polling began in 2002: over three quarters of Europeans think the euro is good for the EU. A record number of Europeans (65%) also think the euro is good for their country. For more information about the history and role of euro, see here.",REAL
805,RUSSIAN DEFENCE EXPENDITURE IS ONLY $44 BILLION,"SUMMARY
The military expenditures of Russia, which NATO was set up to fight, amount to about $44 billion, while the expenses of its European counterpart of the alliance is more than $280 billion, and the US defence budget is estimated at $700 billion. Paradoxically enough to refute the allegations of a Russian military threat.
DISPROOF
According to the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute, the Russian military spending has fallen to the sixth highest in the world in 2018, at $61.4 billion, not $ 44B.
In reality, Russia’s effective military expenditure, based on purchasing power parity (Moscow buys from Russian defence manufacturers in rubles), is more in the range of $150-180 billion per year, with a much higher percentage dedicated to procurement, research and development than Western defence budgets.
The problem is that both military and defence expenditure could be financed from some other portions of the budget. For instance, unlike Western countries, Russia spends its defence budget for nothing more but what is referred to as on-going expenses, a group that encompasses staff wages, property maintenance, and military drills.  Funds for purchasing, repairing and upgrading the army’s military hardware, weapons and other materials come from other parts of the federal budget, which is to a large extent how Russia’s State Armaments Program is financed.
Vast amounts of Russian rubles are spent on secret budget items. U.S. public spending that is classified as secret, or what is called black budget, does not surpass 6 per cent of all expenditures. The amount of hidden, unspecified outlays in the Russian federal budget stands at roughly 60 per cent, a tendency that reveals the army’s financing is far beyond anyone’s control. What Russia actually spends on the military is much higher than it officially declares.",REAL

811,RUSSIA NOT INVOLVED IN THE KILLING OF GEORGIAN CITIZEN,"SUMMARY
There is no evidence that Russian government agencies were involved in the incident (A Georgian citizen was killed on August 23 in Berlin, Germany).
DISPROOF
A recurring narrative of pro-Kremlin disinformation that the West blames Russia unfairly and without evidence.
Regarding the incident in Berlin, a 40-year-old man, Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, was shot dead in a Berlin park just before midday on 23 August 2019. The victim was a Chechen exile who had survived two previous attempts on his life. The Dossier Center, a London-based research group founded by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a Russian former oil billionaire, and other investigation groups, such as Bellingcat, have identified the suspect as Vadim N. Krasikov, a 49-year-old Russian citizen from Siberia who, according to Bellingcat, used fake identity documents to enter Germany a few days before. The German Foreign Office says Russian officials have not responded sufficiently to repeated requests for information, despite repeated high-level and urgent demands. In addition, the German Federal Foreign Office insisted in a statement that ""the Federal Public Prosecutor General has taken over the investigations into this case as there are sufficient grounds to believe that the killing was carried out either on behalf of state authorities of the Russian Federation or of those of the autonomous Chechen Republic as part of the Russian Federation"".

812,NATO LOST ITS LEGITIMACY WITH THE END OF THE COLD WAR,"SUMMARY
NATO’s newest belief is that Russia is a country that poses a threat to its members. NATO lost the legitimacy of its existence with the end of the Cold War.
DISPROOF
This disinformation message is aimed at undermining the image of NATO.
The organization implements the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949, which has no mention of Russia or the USSR.
Since the end of the Cold War, thirteen more countries have chosen to join NATO. Twice since the end of that era, NATO has adopted new Strategic Concepts (in 1999 and 2010), adapting to new realities.
During the Warsaw summit in July 2016, NATO has made it clear that ""The Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia"".
Furthermore, following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the Readiness Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defence and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment.",REAL
813,THE UNION STATE OF BELARUS AND RUSSIA SAVES POST-SOVIET COUNTRIES FROM PRO-FASCIST WEST,"SUMMARY
Following the USSR’s break-up, the West created various funds and organisations in the post-Soviet countries and began meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign countries. The 2004 presidential elections and 2014 Euromaidan in Ukraine were examples of US’ rulings on who should have power in Ukraine. Gradually, post-Soviet countries began turning into colonies of the US with various conflicts and degradation stemming from this fact.
When it comes to eastern policy, old and new EU and NATO countries have clear roles: Western European countries play masters of democracy, human rights, and European values, whereas Eastern European counties (Poland, Czechia, Romania, and the Baltic states) do dirty work by promoting disintegration, bringing tensions and confrontation along the whole perimeter of all-Russian civilisation. In fact, the real policies of the EU and US do not have anything to do with democracy and human rights. They support neo-fascists in the Baltic countries, fascists in Ukraine, followers of Ion Antonescu in Moldova, the anti-Russian regime in Georgia, so-called human rights defenders in Russia and so-called promoters of Belarusian culture in Belarus.
Integration between Belarus and Russia reproduces the USSR to some extent and counteracts the geopolitical dictate of the US. This is the reason behind the information war waged by Western media and their clients in post-Soviet countries against the Union State between Belarus and Russia. There is no alternative to integration between Belarus and Russia. Without unification, the two countries and other post-Soviet republics will not have futures.
DISPROOF
This article is a mix of conspiracies consistent with a number of recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narratives about US-staged Ukrainian events, Western colonial policies in post-Soviet space and elsewhere, pro-fascist West, Baltic states and Ukraine, Western aggressiveness towards Belarus and Russia, and the West's attempts to disrupt Belarus-Russia relations.
It also puts forward a false dilemma about the direction of Belarus's and other post-Soviet countries' political development (union with Russia vs. no future) and promotes the concept of all-Russian civilisation, an imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that is a favoured pro-Kremlin narrative aimed at weakening the national identity of Belarusians and Ukrainians, as well as their sovereignty.

The US did not stage the Ukrainian events in 2004 or 2014. When it comes to Euromaidan, the spontaneous onset of protests was a reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former President Yanukovych’s violent dispersal of peaceful student protests against Yanukovych's sudden decision to withdraw from the Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013.

814,NEW “SKRIPAL CASE” ACTIVELY PROMOTED IN GERMANY,"SUMMARY
A new “Skripal case” is being actively promoted in Germany. It is in the same style as in the UK, with “highly likely” evidence. They are talking about a high-profile murder that took place in Berlin back in August, 2019. But the international scandal was blown up just now, before the important meeting in the “Normandy Format”.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the poisoning of Sergey Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury refuting all evidence of Russia's guilt and evidence provided.
The incident being referred to is the murder of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen, shot at point-blank range by a cyclist in a park in the Berlin neighbourhood of Moabit on the 23rd August 2019. The victim, an ethnic Chechen, is said to have fought against Russia in the Second Chechen War and is believed to have had ties to Georgian military intelligence.
The German Foreign Ministry stated that Russian authorities have not cooperated sufficiently in the investigations into the murder of Khangoshvili. ""There are sufficient factual grounds to suggest that the killing was carried out either on behalf of state agencies of the Russian Federation or those of the Autonomous Chechen Republic, as part of the Russian Federation,"" Germany's federal prosecutor said.
The suspect was detained shortly after the killing when he was allegedly seen dumping a bike, pistol and a wig into the nearby River Spree. The prosecutor says the suspect flew from Moscow to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris six days before the killing under the alias of Vadim S. Vadim S appeared for the first time in a Russian domestic passport in 2015. Recent reports suggested his full name was Vadim Sokolov, 49, although that was not thought to be his real identity.

819,NATO IS A TOOL OF THE GLOBAL CAPITAL BASED IN THE IDEOLOGY OF WHITE SUPREMACISM,"SUMMARY
NATO is a very important tool used by ruling elites to promote their capitalist and white supremacist goals, and its summit in London should be seen as a threat for global humankind.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory, without any evidence provided to support the claims.
NATO is a mutual defence alliance of democratic states aiming to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means. It doesn’t receive orders from global elites, and decisions are taken by consensus among member states. White supremacism doesn’t play any role in the Atlantic Alliance. All its interventions, such as Kosovo, Afghanistan or Libya, were related to international security challenges, not economic interests.
This is part of a recurrent Russian narrative to portray NATO as an aggressive organisation, a US puppet and a tool of Washington’s imperial ambitions with no real substance nor justification to exist. You can see other examples of disinformation against the Atlantic Alliance, such as its obsolescence and its cannibalistic character, its unjustified anti-Russian stance as the only unifying force among its members, its fascistic tendencies or the massive casualties of its bombing campaign against Serbia.",REAL
820,NATO’S EXISTENCE CAUSES THREATS ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE,"SUMMARY
NATO is a relic from the old times. Currently, it is an obstacle for the establishment of a new global security system. By the very fact of its existence and its outdated formula to create an enemy, NATO causes threats on the international stage and hampers global peace. Such countries as Russia and China – especially Russia – have become NATO’s chosen enemies.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative, portraying NATO as a threat to global peace because it has an aggressive agenda.
NATO is a defensive alliance, whose purpose is to protect its member states. Its exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia or any other country. The claim that NATO is encircling or threatening Russia is one of the myths about this organization.
NATO is regularly updating the military requirements for civilian infrastructure, at a time when there are increased challenges to security. Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the Readiness Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defense and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment.

821,"WESTERN POLITICIANS AND THE MEDIA EMBRACE BROWDER’S STORY ABOUT MAGNITSKY WITHOUT EVEN CHECKING IT FIRST
","SUMMARY
Browder’s Justice for Magnitsky campaign could be presumed to personal revenge against Russia. A campaign that uses the deadly fate of the auditor to punish the country that sued him. Why did Western politicians and the media embrace Browder’s story so easily without even checking it first? Probably because his story is in perfect harmony with the disastrous image of Russia in the West.
DISPROOF
This case is part of the pro-Kremlin media's ongoing disinformation campaign against Magnitsky sanctions and their chief proponent, Bill Browder accusing him and the West of Russophobia - a disinformation tactic commonly used by pro-Kremlin outlets to deflect criticism about Moscow's policies by painting Russia as the innocent victim of Western antipathy.
As the CEO of Hermitage Capital, once the largest investment firm in Russia, Bill Browder fell afoul of the Russian government in 2005 after exposing the details of a vast $230-million corruption scheme involving several high-ranking Russian officials. While investigating the corruption scheme, Hermitage Capital’s tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky was arrested. During his 11-month imprisonment, he was tortured, denied medical care, and ultimately left to die. A Russian investigation concluded that Magnitsky had died of natural causes; the case was then closed and Magnitsky was posthumously convicted of tax evasion. To commemorate Magnitsky, Bill Browder launched a campaign to sanction the individuals involved in his mistreatment and death. This campaign has led the United States and several other countries (the UK, Canada, and the Baltic States) to adopt so-called 'Magnitsky sanctions' that restrict the travel and freeze the assets of individuals who have been involved in human rights abuses and mass corruption.
The case of Sergei Magnitsky has been widely studied by investigative journalists, subjected to investigative TV programs (giving the floor to all protagonists), and examined by the anti-corruption NGO Transparency International which posthumously bestowed its integrity award to Magnitsky. Moreover, in August 2019, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russian authorities “had deprived Sergei Magnitskiy of important medical care and had failed to comply with their duty to protect his life.” The judges unanimously concluded that Magnitsky's treatment in detention violated his human rights, the right to live, right to liberty and security, and right to freedom from torture.

822,INTERNAL OPCW E-MAIL PROVES THAT OPCW’S DOUMA INVESTIGATION IS BIASED,"SUMMARY
What really happened on April 7, 2018, in Douma, Syria? The Western version, according to which a chemical attack has been perpetrated by the Syrian army, has become more and more fragile in recent days. It is an email sent by a member of the OPCW mission to Syria,  unveiled by WikiLeaks, which is causing the trouble. According to it, the conclusions would have been distorted in the official report of the OPCW.
There were already the reservations of some journalists in Syria and even that of a producer of the BBC. Now critics are coming from people directly involved in the investigation. An e-mail from one who introduces himself as one of the members of this mission in Syria has been unveiled by Wikileaks. The sender of this email regrets a misleading rewrite of his observations: “By the unintentional omission of certain facts and observations an inadvertent bias has been introduced into the report, undermining its credibility. In fact, some crucial facts that have been maintained in the corrected version have turned into something quite different from what was originally drafted.”
The core of the problem observed by the author of the e-mail is, in particular, the conclusions about the presence of bottles of chlorine on the scene of the alleged attack.”The initial report underscored the fact that, although the cylinders may have been the source of the suspected release of chemicals, the evidence was insufficient to assert this and it is a major difference with from the redacted report…”
DISPROOF
WikiLeaks indeed released an email from an employee within the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) indicating that the OPCW ""misrepresents the facts he and his colleagues discovered on the ground"". This email has been used to call into question the impartiality and effectiveness of the OPCW’s conclusion about the alleged chemical weapon attack in Douma, Syria. But the comparison of the date when it was written and of the points raised in the letter with the OPCW's final report makes it clear that the OPCW addressed these concerns of said employee. Unusually, OPCW issued two reports on Douma, the preliminary and the final ones. The concerns of the said employee have been taken into account in the final report, points out Belingcat.
The e-mail is dated 22 June 2018. Thus, the interim report, published on 6 July 2018, stated that the found cylinders were the likely source of the chlorine or reactive chlorine-containing chemical. The final report published on 1 March 2019 states, however, in paragraph 2.16 that it was “possible that the cylinders were the source of the substances containing reactive chlorine”. See the analysis by Bellingcat of how the concerns of the said employee raised in June 2018, were taken into account in the final OPCW's report released on 6 July 2018.
The narrative of the insufficient proofs of using chemical weapons in Syria and of the ""staged chemical attacks"" is recurrent. Read previous debunk claiming that a BBC producer admits the chemical attacks were staged. See more cases here.
It is to note that RT France received a reprimand from French regulator CSA, which was recently maintained by State Council after the appeal, for its biased coverage of the chemical attack in Douma in April 2018. In the reprimanded report RT France did false voice-overs of two interviews of Syrian citizens, distorting their messages. In addition, the French regulator noticed that the whole 18 minutes of Douma's incident coverage by RT France broke the Convention signed with the regulator. The convention obliges the channel to check the credibility of its information. ""Because of a confusion between the presentation of the facts and their commentary and the choice of banners as 'simulated attacks', the channel gave the impression that the fictitious nature of the chemical attacks occurring in the city of Douma on 7 April 2018 was an established fact, although it was an uncertain and controversial fact, which justified the sending of a mission of the OPCW. The only intervention on the board of an 'international strategy advisor' stating that the Syrian Army did not use chemical weapons, that the jihadists had manufacturing laboratories of such and that public opinion in Western countries was manipulated, without any other element of the program counterbalancing its words, led to a univocal presentation of a controversial issue,"" states the French State Council's decision.
RT France called the false voice overs ""a simple technical mistake and in no way a failure to respect honest information coverage"". The channel recognized that only one expert was invited to the panel to discuss the attack but called it an honest coverage.",REAL
823,AGENTS OF GEORGE SOROS ARE DESTROYING ARMENIAN STATEHOOD,"SUMMARY
There is a large network of Soros agents in Armenia. The minister of science, education, culture and sport is pursuing Soros policies of discrediting national values. The Prime Minister is also in the process of destroying the Armenian statehood, in line with Soros program.

824,CRIMEAN PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR DESIRE TO REJOIN RUSSIA IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS,"SUMMARY
Crimea rejoined Russia after the referendum that took place in March 2014, when 96.77 percent of voters in the Crimean Republic and 95.6 percent of Sevastopol residents voted in favour of joining Russia. This was after the overthrow of the regime in Ukraine in February 2014. The Russian leadership has announced many times that the Crimean people have expressed their desire to join Russia again, during a democratic process that fully responds to the requirements of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on the annexation of Crimea claiming that Crimean citizens chose to rejoin Russia through a legal referendum.
No international body recognises the so-called referendum, announced on the 27th of February 2014, and held on 16th of March 2014.
A year after the illegal annexation, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted that the plan to annex Crimea was ordered weeks before the so-called referendum.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.""
On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
The EU's policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity. In March 2019 on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. EU continues to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, supporting its sovereignty and territorial integrity.",REAL
825,TAX-CHEATING JEWISH OLIGARCH KEEPS LYING ABOUT HIS DEAD AUDITOR TO MAKE EVERYONE HATE RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Tax-cheating Jewish oligarch [Bill Browder] keeps lying about his dead auditor to make everyone hate Russia. For years Browder – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s self-proclaimed “enemy number one” and head of the Hermitage Capital Management fund – has been waging what can only be described as his personal anti-Russia campaign.
DISPROOF
This case is part of the pro-Kremlin media's ongoing disinformation campaign against Magnitsky sanctions and their chief proponent, Bill Browder. The article uses anti-Semitism to attack Browder and accuses him of Russophobia - a disinformation tactic commonly used by pro-Kremlin outlets to deflect criticism about Moscow's policies by painting Russia as the innocent victim of Western antipathy.

A Russian investigation concluded that Magnitsky had died of natural causes; the case was then closed and Magnitsky was posthumously convicted of tax evasion. To commemorate Magnitsky, Bill Browder launched a campaign to sanction the individuals involved in his mistreatment and death. This campaign has led the United States and several other countries (the UK, Canada, and the Baltic States) to adopt so-called 'Magnitsky sanctions' that restrict the travel and freeze the assets of individuals who have been involved in human rights abuses and mass corruption.  EU foreign affairs ministers have also agreed to launch the preparatory work for a global sanctions regime to address serious human rights violations, which will be the EU equivalent of the so-called Magnitsky Act of the United States, EU High Representative/Vice President Josep Borrell said. 
The case of Sergei Magnitsky has been widely studied by investigative journalists, subjected to investigative TV programs (giving the floor to all protagonists), and examined by the anti-corruption NGO Transparency International which posthumously bestowed its integrity award to Magnitsky. Moreover, in August 2019, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russian authorities “had deprived Sergei Magnitskiy of important medical care and had failed to comply with their duty to protect his life.” The judges unanimously concluded that Magnitsky's treatment in detention violated his human rights, the right to live, right to liberty and security, and right to freedom from torture.

831,THE US IS POLAND’S MASTER,"SUMMARY
Poland is trying to serve two masters at the same time, not only relying on European Union funds, but also trying to bow to the United States of America. Perhaps it will become a base for Washington in the old world or will receive a large grant to defend American interests.
DISPROOF
A common pro-Kremlin narrative on the “lost sovereignty”  of Poland, which is often presented as a “puppet-state” of the United States. The statement that Poland is submissive to the will of the United States is a conspiracy theory. Poland is a sovereign state, which shapes its own foreign and domestic policies.

832,NATO REPRESENTS A THREAT TO RUSSIAN SECURITY,"SUMMARY
NATO was formed to confront the Soviet Union. There is now neither the Soviet Union nor the Warsaw Treaty, that is, the military alliance established in response to the creation of NATO. However, NATO is still present and even expanding. At the moment of its formation, the Alliance included 12 countries, but the number of members now is 29, while the total military spending of the alliance exceeds 70% of global military spending. Today we must start from the fact that NATO expansion and infrastructure development near the Russian border represent one of the potential threats to our country’s security.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative on Western attempts to encircle Russia and portraying military exercises as security threats.
The claim that NATO is encircling Russia is one of the myths about NATO. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, less than one-sixteenth (1,215 kilometres), is shared with NATO members. Russia has land borders with 14 countries. Only five of them are NATO members. Outside NATO territory, the Alliance only has a military presence in two places: Kosovo and Afghanistan.
NATO poses no threat to Russia. All Allies reaffirmed at the Brussels Summit that ""the Alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia"". NATO is a defensive alliance. Its purpose is to protect the member states. NATO's exercises and military deployments are not directed against Russia, Belarus or any other country. NATO does not seek confrontation, but it cannot ignore Russia breaking international rules, undermining stability and security.

833,THE US IS SENDING NAZI MILITANTS OF THE AZOV BATTALION TO HONG KONG PROTESTS,"SUMMARY
After images of Ukrainian Nazis posing with demonstrators in Hong Kong emerged on social media, the question of who is paying their flight and accommodation is rhetorical: it seems that the period of bringing extremists to Hong Kong from all over the country to take part in the US-promoted protests is over, now they are being brought from all over the world.

Conspiracy theory. No proof is provided to support the claim.
The story is based on a post published on a Russian blog. There is no evidence that the US is paying for the travel expenses of these members of the Ukrainian far-right, who publicised their trip on social media, and their presence seems to have been rejected by many voices in the Hong Kong protest movement.

835,SPUTNIK IS THE VICTIM OF AN UNPRECEDENTED PERSECUTION IN “TOTALITARIAN” ESTONIA,"SUMMARY
Sputnik News Agency is suffering an unprecedented persecution in Estonia. The country’s authorities unleashed a campaign aiming to block the work of Sputnik Estonia and deprive audiences of an alternative source of information on the situation of the country and the world. Estonia talks a lot about its commitments to democratic values, such as press freedom, but this case shows that it’s the opposite. The country represents a totalitarian machine unmatched in the world.
DISPROOF
There is no persecution against Sputnik in Estonia. The agency has been forced to move out of its office in Tallinn because of its inability to pay the rent due to sanctions. In October 2019, Estonia-based branches of the foreign banks that operated the accounts of Rossiya Segodnya, the mother company of Sputnik, froze all its transfers, while other banks in Estonia refused to operate with the firm. This is the result of the sanctions imposed by the European Union on Dmitry Kiselyov, the director general of Rossiya Segodnya, following the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis.
Banks in Estonia are not the only institutions to have taken action against Rossiya Segodnya for this reason. In 2015, Barclay’s bank closed the account used by the agency in UK. In 2016 Latvia's domain registry shut the website of Sputnik Latvia after receiving a letter of concern from the Latvian Foreign Ministry, which drew attention to Sputnik's coverage of Ukraine and routine denial of the embattled nation's territorial integrity. In July 2019, Latvian authorities blocked access to the online portal baltnews.lv, owned by Rossiya Segodnya, because of the EU sanctions. In mid-2019 a court in Vilnius ruled on blocking Sputnik Lithuania over copyright issues.
Estonia is ranked as the 11th freest country in the world for press by Reporters Without Borders. Estonia is considered a consolidated democracy by Freedom House and a Flawed Democracy by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, similar to countries like the US, Japan, France, Portugal or Belgium. Thus, Estonia is by no means a totalitarian regime.

837,"UKRAINE’S RUSSIAN SPEAKERS REVOLTED AGAINST NATIONALIST COUP IN KYIV
","SUMMARY
In 2014, pro-Western ultra-nationalists led a coup d’etat in Kyiv, which precipitated a revolt by Russian-speaking provinces in the country’s east and south.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative painting the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests as a coup d'etat, Russia's armed aggression in the Donbas as an internal Ukrainian conflict, and the war as a result of the alleged discrimination which Russian speakers are facing in Ukraine.
The Euromaidan was not a coup but a nationwide popular uprising stemming from the government's last-minute decision not to sign the EU Association Agreement. See the full debunk here. Regarding the protests led by ultra-nationalists - the latter had a very limited presence throughout the Euromaidan and have consistently failed to win any parliamentary mandates since 2014.
The war in Eastern Ukraine was provoked by the pro-Russian separatists and mercenaries funded and supported directly by Russia. There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine. The international community, including the European Union, recognises and condemns clear violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014 when Russia intervened in Crimea and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula on March 16, 2014.
The war was not provoked by language issues. On the contrary, many Ukrainian citizens from the predominantly Russian speaking Southern and Eastern oblasts actively participated in the events in the Euromaidan and supported the European integration of Ukraine. According to a survey, 27% of Euromaidan participants were Russian speakers and 18% were bilinguals.",REAL

839,JIT IGNORES RUSSIAN ARGUMENTS AND DATA PROVIDED FROM ALMAY-ANTEY ON MH17 DOWNING,"SUMMARY
Some countries mentioned a sad incident, the tragedy with the Malaysian Boeing. And again our colleague said that Russia does not cooperate with the investigation, with the international investigation.
Firstly I want to state, no one asked Russia to cooperate in this JIT-group.
Secondly, the facts which Russia provided to this investigation JIT-group in terms of quantity and quality outbid any contributions that any other country made to this investigation. These are primary raw data from the radar, a field trial conducted by Almaz-Antey and much more.
But to the simple question: “Where are the data from the Ukrainian radar, where are the records of the Ukrainian dispatchers and where are the long promised satellite images of the USA – then nobody can answer us.”
DISPROOF
One of the many recurring and occasionally competing disinformation narratives around the downing of flight MH17.
The claims by Buk manufacturer Almaz-Antey were debunked already in 2015 by Bellingcat. Russia's interest in aiding the JIT investigation is not a relevant condition of its membership in JIT. The crash did not take place over Russian territory and claimed no Russian lives, which precludes any basis for Moscow to be represented in the JIT. Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke told a Russian newspaper that ""if MH17 were shot down over Russia, I would have suggested that Russia be made a member of the JIT group.""
The ""evidence"" claimed by Russia, namely radar data and the ""field experiment"" conducted by the Russian military company Almaz-Antey, is only a small sample of misleading claims advanced by Moscow since 2015, some of which have contradicted one another.
The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation.
In September 2016, the JIT disclosed that MH17 was downed with a BUK missile of the 9M38 series. In Eastern Ukraine, two parts of such a missile were found. These parts are the so-called ‘venturi’ and the ‘casing’. This regards, on the one hand, the exhaust of the missile (venturi) and on the other hand the casing of the missile engine (casing). The missile engine’s casing shows the number 9 д 1318869032. The JIT-investigation up to now has found that 9д 131 relates to the number of the missile engine of the 9M38 type and/or 9M38M1 type. The number 8 is the manufacturer’s code, namely: the Dolgoprudny Research and Manufacturing Enterprise in Moscow. The number 86 indicates the year of production, namely 1986. And the number 9032 is the unique identification number of this specific missile engine.
The European Union and NATO have called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT’s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are formally holding Russia accountable.",REAL
840,"UKRAINE WILL DISINTEGRATE BY 2023, THE US-RULED OCCUPYING REGIME WILL TAKE LIVING SPACE AWAY FROM UKRAINIANS
","SUMMARY
Anglo-Saxons have turned Ukraine anti-Russian. The US still needs Ukraine as a springboard for anti-Russian military provocations. Ukraine’s occupying powers gave the main state security body to the US to control directly. In addition, the legalisation of land sales in Ukraine will be a jackpot for foreign landowners.
In fact, the living space of the Ukrainian people will be taken away. Once new masters own Ukrainian land, Ukrainian military forces will give armed support to the occupying regime and suppress any popular resistance. Above all, by 2023, five seaside Ukrainian regions will form a new state.
DISPROOF
This article discredits the legal Ukrainian authorities by groundlessly naming them as occupational. It also contains popular anti-Ukrainian, pro-Kremlin propagandistic claims about Ukraine as an anti-Russian tool under external control and Ukraine's disintegration and imminent collapse.
Ukraine is a sovereign state, not controlled by any foreign government. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world, including the EU. The US and the European Union continue to support Ukraine, its territorial integrity, and sovereignty against Russian aggression.
In November 2019, the Ukrainian parliament passed on the first reading a key land reform bill to create a land market and open up the sale of farmland from 2020, which is anticipated to greatly boost Ukraine's economy. If the bill is adopted in the second reading and signed by the president, it will introduce a land market by removing the existing ban on sales of agricultural land, allowing Ukrainians and Ukrainian-registered companies to trade land. This reform has been cited multiple times as a key requirement for receiving another International Monetary Fund aid package. The reform is supported by EU. In a statement on Facebook, the EU delegation to Ukraine wrote: ""The reform should be based on the rule of law and the principles of sustainability, transparency, fairness and inclusiveness. Respecting Ukraine's independent legislative process and sovereign decision-making, we stand ready to offer experience and support, together with other international partners.""  For a more in-depth overview and history of Ukraine's land reform process, see here.
During the conference “Land as a factor in the development of the Ukrainian village,” President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that “in the model that we offer with the government, only Ukrainian citizens or Ukrainian companies can buy or sell land. Horror stories about the Chinese, Arabs or aliens who will take our land by wagons - this is nonsense. The land is the property of citizens,” said Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

845,THE PORTON DOWN LABORATORY WAS INVOLVED IN THE POISONING AND ATTEMPTED MURDER OF SERGEY SKRIPAL AND HIS DAUGHTER,"SUMMARY
The Porton Down Laboratory was involved in the poisoning and attempted murder of Sergey Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. It is worth remembering that the famous Porton Down laboratory, specialised in the study, development and countering of chemical and bacteriological weapons, is located near Salisbury.
Western media are silent about the involvement of the Porton Down laboratory in the Skripal poisoning and about the Novichok that could be hidden in this laboratory. Instead of serious investigative journalism, Western media have published an increasing number of Russophobic and fantasy-based “spy novels” and “detective stories” about the Skripal case.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. No evidence is given. Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the Skripal poisoning in the UK claiming that the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down, a UK Ministry of Defence agency, was somehow responsible for the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury and that the Laboratory might have manufactured Novichok.
This conspiracy theory is one of the many competing and contradictory narratives promulgated by Russian state-controlled media, to confuse their audience and exclude any possibility of Russian involvement (see our article on EU vs Disinformation). British police and intelligence investigations have produced hard forensic evidence which was sufficient to charge two Russian nationals, identified as officers of the Russian Military Intelligence, GRU, for the attack on the Skripals. Parts of the material have been released to the public.
The toxin used in the attack was identified as a nerve agent at the Porton Down Laboratory. The Laboratory has not done tests with nerve agents since 1989 but is still able to identify these toxins, to protect British civilians and troops from attacks. The nerve agent has been identified as Novichok (which means newcomer in Russian). It is known to be more powerful than VX and was developed in Russia in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok is so unusual that very few scientists outside of Russia have any real experience in dealing with it and no country outside of Russia is known to have developed the substance.

846,"WESTERN JOURNALISM IS DOMINATED BY RUSSOPHOBIA AND PREFERS FANTASY AND STORY-TELLING TO OBJECTIVE REPORTING
","SUMMARY
After the Skripal case, even the most respected Western media have increasingly discarded objective reporting and have substituted the latter with Russophobic fantasy stories and spy-fiction. The most recent examples of Russophobic spy-fiction is a Le Monde article, and a previous New York Times article, on an alleged top-secret Russian intelligence unit that engaged in “destabilising activities” throughout Europe.
Western journalism, and many aspects of Western culture, are increasingly Russophobic, Sinophobic and phobic towards any actor that is critical of dominant Western globalist thinking. Russia can be accused without any argument or evidence to support the accusations, and it is up to Russia to prove its innocence. The Western media system has deteriorated, it is no longer based on objective information but on scandals, accusations, commercial considerations and geopolitical motivations.
DISPROOF
No evidence is given. Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the spread of Russophobia in Western media, which also allegedly censors views that are critical of dominant Western narratives. A second recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative aims at discrediting investigative journalists that research Kremlin-sponsored, hostile, influence activities in the West, by claiming they are Russophobic and that their investigations are based on false information and dubious sources.
The Western media cannot be described as “Russophobic” nor as dominated by a ruling “globalist paradigm”. Media in pluralist democracies represent a wide range of political opinions and do not have a single editorial policy for any country or topic. Several journalistic investigations on topics such as the Skripal case have been based on serious research work and can in no way be described as “Russophobic”.

847,RUSSIA DID NOT VIOLATE THE BUDAPEST MEMORANDUM,"SUMMARY
The Budapest memorandum does not work and it is Ukraine’s own fault, Ukraine has allowed a civil war on its territory. Russia did not violate this treaty because it did not use nuclear weapons against Ukraine.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation that there is a civil war in Ukraine. The war in eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict, but a well-documented act of aggression by Russian armed forces, ongoing since February 2014.
The mentioned Budapest Memorandum is a diplomatic document that was signed in December 1994 by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Under the memorandum, Ukraine promised to remove all Soviet-era nuclear weapons, which Ukraine received after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The arsenal Ukraine was left with was the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, including intercontinental ballistic missiles and strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons. On 24 October 1991, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a statement on the country's nuclear-free status. Three years later, Ukraine actually joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaties. In exchange, the leaders of the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom signed the Budapest memorandum with guarantees of the integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.
The Budapest memorandum says that not one of the countries that signed the document has the right to apply any kind of aggressive policy towards Ukraine. The second paragraph states that the signatories ""reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine.""

The description under the video “Krím-Félsziget, Oroszország - 2019. November 27” is translated as “Crimea Peninsula, Russia - 2019. November 27.” This was broadcast on 29 November. The Embassy of Ukraine in Hungary turned to the M1 TV channel with a request to correct the inscription in the video. At the moment, the video has been removed from the channel’s website and from social media.
After the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014, Hungary announced that it would not recognise the occupation of Crimea. This is the official position of both the Hungarian government and the European Union as a whole, which remains unchanged to this day.
The EU policy on non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a whole range of measures. In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and deliberate destabilisation of a neighbouring sovereign country, the EU has imposed restrictive measures against Russia.",REAL
851,RUSSIA IS NOT A PARTY TO THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE,"SUMMARY
Russia only provides political, economic and humanitarian support to the people of Donetsk and Luhansk who broke away from Kyiv after an unconstitutional coup in Ukraine in early 2014. Russia insists that it is not a party to the conflict and that reaching a resolution requires direct negotiation between Kyiv and the two republics of Donbas.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative denying Russia's role in the war in Ukraine. It disregards the extensive factual evidence confirming ongoing Russian military presence in Eastern Ukraine. There have been many publicly available reports proving Russia's involvement in the war.
The war in Eastern Ukraine is not a civil conflict, but an act of aggression by the Russian armed forces, that has been ongoing since February 2014.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that “the information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation"". This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"". At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014 and at successive summits since then, allied leaders also demanded that Russia refrains from aggressive actions against Ukraine and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.

852,EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN NATO ARE UNDER WASHINGTON’S POLITICAL AND MILITARY CONTROL,"SUMMARY
With NATO expansion in Eastern Europe the plan to encircle Russia is complete. Eastern European countries that have joined (or have been forced to join) NATO are now under Washington’s total political and military control. The intelligence services of these countries are also under US control.
DISPROOF
Conspiracy theory. No evidence is provided for the article’s claims.
Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, less than one-sixteenth (1,215 kilometres), is shared with NATO members. Russia has land borders with 14 countries. Only five of them are NATO members.
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about  NATO as a tool used by the US to control the policies of European states. This narrative claims that almost all European countries are no longer truly sovereign and the United States dictates EU and member states policies.
NATO is a political and military alliance, and NATO member states make sovereign decisions about their own security. NATO and US military presence in these states is possible only on the basis of the clear consent of the hosting nation.

The “green madness” that has captured the Western world has already had serious economic consequences. If the two symbolic figures of the global “green movement”, Greta Thunberg and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, get their way, the world will never be the same again, and Russia and China are likely to remain the last islands of common sense in a world that wants to forget common sense.

854,"NATO IS TRYING TO DOMINATE THE WHOLE WORLD
","SUMMARY
NATO’s adoption of the biggest budget in its history clearly demonstrates the alliance’s quest for hegemony in the whole world, including the Middle East.
DISPROOF
A conspiracy theory based on no evidence trying to portray the West and the NATO as trying to dominate the world, and claiming that NATO is de facto aggressive.
NATO is a defensive alliance, whose purpose is to protect its member states. Its exercises and military deployments are not directed against any country, and its membership is geographically bounded and restricted to European and North American countries.
As for the claim that the increase in budget is evidence for the NATO's desire to dominate the world, those increases emerged as a response to a changed security environment, including a more assertive Russia, cyber and hybrid threats, instability across the Middle East and North Africa, and a continued terrorist threat. As a result, NATO allies pledged in 2014 to stop cuts to their defence budgets, increase defence spending, and move towards investing 2% of their GDP on defence within a decade. Since then, we have seen five consecutive years of growth in defence expenditure. This is about ensuring that NATO has the capabilities it needs to protect its populations against any threat, from any direction.",REAL
855,"NEO-BANDERAS’ UKRAINE IS UNDER THE US AND NATO CONTROL
","SUMMARY
Verbal “fights” between neo-Banderas’ Ukraine and Russia are usual. The Banderas crossed all lines of decency. So, Ukraine continues to play the role of “Russia’s irritant”. This role was assigned to Ukraine by its masters, the US leaders and NATO commanders.
DISPROOF
Recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative, challenging Ukrainian statehood, painting Ukraine as a geopolitical hostage of the United States, claiming that the United States and NATO control Ukraine’s foreign and domestic policies.
Ukraine is a sovereign state. Neither the US nor NATO controls Ukraine. The United States recognised Ukraine as an independent state on December 25, 1991. Since then, Washington has been working closely with Ukraine, directing its assistance to support the development of a safe, democratic and free Ukraine, fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic community. The European Union also supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. Ukraine is a priority partner for the EU. In June 2014, the EU and Ukraine signed an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, which promotes deeper political ties, stronger economic links and the respect for common values.
The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine are respected by most of the free world but were violated by Russia in 2014.

856,THE CRIMEAN PEOPLE CHOSE TO BE WITH RUSSIA THROUGH DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURE,"SUMMARY
Democracy implies that people themselves determine the form of their existence. The Crimean people have chosen to be with Russia through democratic procedures, and this is not taken into account.
DISPROOF
This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative on Russia's annexation of Crimea, claiming that people living in Crime chose to rejoin Russia through a legal and democratic referendum.
No international body has recognised the so-called referendum, announced on 27 February 2014, and held on 16 March 2014, which was organised by self-proclaimed Crimean leadership lacking democratic legitimacy and installed by armed Russian military personnel following the seizure of public buildings.
The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February 2014 when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.""
On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it stated that the referendum in Crimea was not valid and could not serve as a basis for any change in the status of the peninsula. On 17 December 2018, the UN General Assembly confirmed its non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea.
The EU's policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol includes a set of restrictive measures against entities and individuals responsible for actions against Ukraine's territorial integrity. In March 2019, on the fifth anniversary of Crimea's annexation, the EU reiterated its position of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol.",REAL
857,"NATO IS ENCIRCLING RUSSIA’S BORDERS AND CREATING AN ENEMY IMAGE OF RUSSIA
","SUMMARY
We do not see a movement towards mutual security, but a movement in the opposite direction. The architecture of strategic stability is destroyed, and the security space is divided into individual fragments. One tries to replace the international legal system by the so-called ‘rule-based order’, the foreign policy (interests) formulated by a small group of Western countries.
NATO has expanded in several waves – it wants to be the source of legitimacy. Its military infrastructure has already reached Russia’s borders and NATO has intensively expanded its military potential in Eastern Europe, increased its arms spending to record levels and at the same time created an enemy image of Russia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about NATO threatening Russia.
NATO is not encircling Russia. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, less than one-sixteenth (1,215 kilometres), is shared with NATO members. Russia has land borders with 14 countries. Only five of them are NATO members.
Also, NATO has reached out to Russia consistently, transparently and publicly over the past 26 years. The Alliance created unique cooperation bodies – the Permanent Joint Council and the NATO-Russia Council – to embody its relationship with Russia. It has invited Russia to cooperate on missile defence, an invitation extended to no other partner. Bilateral agreements between the US and host nations do not allow missile sites to be used for any purpose other than missile defence.",REAL
858,NATO NEVER WANTED TO COOPERATE WITH RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
NATO had several chances to include Russia in the common defence system, but this idea has been constantly refused for 70 years, which indicates the direction of the Alliance against Russia.
DISPROOF
A recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about aggressive, anti-Russian Western policies
In fact, there were many instances of NATO reaching out to Russia. NATO's relations with Russia started after the end of the Cold War when Russia joined the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (1991). Practical cooperation started after Russia joined the Partnership for Peace programme (1994) and deployed peacekeepers in support of NATO-led peace-support operations in the Western Balkans in the late 1990s. Dialogue and cooperation were strengthened in 2002 with the establishment of the NATO-Russia Council (NRC) to serve as a forum for consultation on current security issues and to direct practical cooperation.
NATO suspended practical cooperation with Russia due to its aggressive actions in Ukraine. However, NATO continues to keep channels for political dialogue open. The NATO-Russia Council, an important platform for dialogue, has never been suspended. There have been ten meetings since 2016.",REAL
859,"TO CONTAIN AND INTIMIDATE RUSSIA, THE WEST CAME UP WITH A NEW SKRIPAL-LIKE KHANGOSHVILI MURDER STORY","SUMMARY
The story of murdered Chechen insurgent Zelimkhan Khangoshvili is strikingly similar to the Skripal case. In both cases Western media started their information campaigns only after some time: a week after the poisoning in the Skripal case and four months following Khangoshvili’s murder. The thing is in summer 2019 the West was seemingly interested in improving relations with Russia, so anti-Russian activists who started speaking about “Kremlin’s arm” and “mayhem” created by Russian security bodies in Europe, suddenly shut up for some time. In both cases, no conclusive proofs of Russian implication have been presented.
By all accounts, in both cases, there was a political decision to find a good reason to wage an information war against growing Russia. On the eve of Salisbury poisoning, Vladimir Putin demonstrated Russian brand-new hypersonic weapon which devalued the American anti-missile system and NATO infrastructure and made Russia the only country totally free from US’s military coercion.
The year of 2019 has also been successful for Moscow,  Russia does very well at the international stage. We are observing Russian negotiations about deeper integration with Belarus, its interim victory in Moldova, and Uzbekistan’s plans to enter the Eurasian Economic Union. In order to contain Russia and to make its position at the Normandy summit softer, Russia is being intimidated by Khangoshvili’s murder as a new Skripal case. It will not work though, and the Skripal case proved just that. Russia will be named a threat to the whole mankind again but talks with it will continue anyway.
DISPROOF
This is a mix of conspiracies suggesting Western Russophobia and coordinated Western media campaign against Russia in Skripal and Khangoshvili cases. The publication groundlessly presents two cases as Western provocations to punish Russia for its alleged successes in the military and foreign policy spheres.
It is reported that Germany’s chief public prosecutor suspects Russian intelligence agencies to be behind the killing of a former Chechen insurgent Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in Berlin and plans to take over investigations into the case. The assassin who shot Khangoshvili on 23 August 2019 was arrested by German police. He had travelled to Germany on a Russian passport issued in the name of Vadim Sokolov, but the document's authenticity is questioned.
In the case of the Skripal poisoning, the pro-Kremlin disinformation machine has pursued frenetic damage control since news of the attack first broke, churning out all manner of denials, fabrications, and feverish conspiracy theories to obscure Russia’s responsibility for the poisoning, cast doubt on the findings of the British investigation, and find a scapegoat (or fifty) to blame for the attack, our past analysis Conspiracy Mania Marks One-Year Anniversary of the Skripal Poisoning explains more.
Our past analysis explains that the “Russophobia” myth comes as an explanation of almost any foreign criticism of Kremlin policies in pro-Kremlin media.

865,"IN PURSUIT OF 4TH REICH, ANGLO-SAXONS ORGANISED RUSSIAN CIVIL WAR AND HONG KONG PROTESTS","SUMMARY
A better look allows us to discern the natural flow of events from the subversive propaganda of Americans and Anglo-Saxons who claim world domination, a sort of Fourth thousand-year Reich. Since China is not willing to accept American world order and promotes an alternative model for globalisation, it should experience a colour revolution. The US does not have the guts to arrange it in Beijing, so Hong Kong was burnt first, a peripheral China with a large concentration of US secret services. The situation is presented as if the protests are organised by ordinary disgruntled citizens rather than Washington’s puppeteers. Without Western meddling, neither the Russian Civil War a hundred years ago nor the protests in Hong Kong would have happened.
DISPROOF
This is a conspiracy theory which presents many social and political events in various countries as a consequence of Western instigated provocations against Russia and China. and consistent with recurring pro-Kremlin narratives about the Nazi-like West, the US or West funding the Hong Kong’ protests, and the West's anti-Russian activities.
Pro-Kremlin media have long used the narrative about anti-government protests being funded by the US. Examples include colour revolutions in post-Soviet states, the “Arab Spring” revolts, and Ukraine's Euromaidan in 2014. They also often use the accusation of Nazism as explained in our past analysis Nazi east, Nazi west, Nazi over the cuckoo's nest.
The protests in Hong Kong started in June 2019 over a controversial extradition law, but have expanded to call for Hong Kong's leader to step down, an inquiry into alleged police brutality, for those who have been arrested to be released and greater democratic freedoms. When it comes to the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922, British, French and American units were sent to Russian ports to support White forces, but they rarely directly engaged the Bolsheviks, and the War had a number of more important domestic roots, foremost, widespread resistance to the new Bolshevik order.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that the US is like 4th Reich, that the Hong Kong protests are the West’s revenge on China for not waging war against Russia, that the goal of the US global “Anaconda” strategy is to limit the living space of geopolitical opponents, and that the West's objective is to encircle Russia entirely thanks to the ""Anaconda ring"" and ""Great Turan"" doctrines.",REAL

DISPROOF
Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that Ukraine started a war in Donbas and occupied the territories of the so-called “DNR” and “LNR”.
The territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts (regions) are internationally recognised parts of Ukraine. The EU has on numerous times mentioned that Ukraine’s borders must be respected. On 27 March 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262 confirming Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

There is a fresh poll of Ukrainians, which shows the following. To the question: “Do you think it is necessary to compromise with Russia and the leaders of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics, to achieve peace?” 72.5% of Ukrainians answer yes.

Manipulation of the poll results. It is designed to create the narrative that most Ukrainians support achieving peace in Donbas at any cost.
A nationwide public opinion survey was conducted by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation by Ilko Kucheriv in collaboration with the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology from 4-19 November 2019. According to it, only 14% of Ukrainians believe that for the sake of peace it is worth agreeing on any compromises.

879,NATO IS AN INEFFECTIVE RELIC OF THE COLD WAR,"SUMMARY
Relying on NATO, which is an ineffective historical relic of the Cold War, is blatantly stupid and this mantra can be sustained only through massive propaganda. NATO is increasingly trying to drag us into wars that have nothing to do with the security of its members.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative undermining NATO's role as a defensive military alliance.
No evidence is given for the claim that NATO is attempting to initiate and drag its members into wars that have nothing to do with their security. This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative alleging that NATO has an aggressive agenda and is a threat to international peace and security.
Concerning the claim that NATO is the relic of the Cold War, at the London Summit in 1990, Allied heads of state and government agreed ""to keep standing together, to extend the long peace"". This was their sovereign choice and was fully in line with their right for collective defence. Since then, thirteen more countries have chosen to join NATO. Twice since the end of the Cold War, NATO has adopted new Strategic Concepts (in 1999 and 2010), adapting to new realities. Thus, rather than being disbanded as a relic, NATO adapted, and continues to change, to live up to the needs and expectations of Allies, and to promote their shared vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace.
After Russia’s annexation of Crimea and amid emerging security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa in 2014, NATO leaders at the Wales Summit adopted the Readiness Action Plan, a comprehensive package of enhanced collective defence and deterrent measures designed to ensure the transatlantic alliance could respond swiftly and firmly to changes in its security environment.
See similar cases such as NATO is monstrous Cold war relic, NATO cultivates Cold War thinking and considers Russia as an enemy, NATO is fully subordinated to the USA, and Baltic states, Moldova, Poland are NATO “hostages”.",REAL

887,OPCW COVERED UP THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN DOUMA,"SUMMARY
The “Wikileaks” website published last November an email from a member of the “Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons” investigation team about the alleged chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma in 2018, in which he accused the organization of covering up a defect in the report alleging the use of chlorine in Douma.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin narrative seeking to absolve the Assad regime of responsibility for chemical attacks perpetrated in the course of the Syrian civil war, as well as to undermine the credibility and independence of the OPCW.
The internal OPCW e-mail message sent to WikiLeaks on June 22, 2018, by an unidentified member of OPCW’s Fact-Finding Mission (FFM), does not accuse the OPCW management of deliberately manipulating and suppressing evidence gathered by the FFM in order to blame the Assad government for the Douma attack and to justify Western military intervention against Syria.
For example, the management's draft said that chlorine or another reactive chlorine-containing chemical was ""likely"" to have been released from two cylinders found at the scene. The email argues, instead, that while the cylinders might have been the sources of the suspected chemical there was ""insufficient evidence to affirm this"".
The e-mail message actually refers to a draft OPCW  interim report, not to the final report published in March 2019. The interim report published in July 2018 was basically a progress report which described the FFM’s activities until that date. The final OPCW report actually accepts the points made by the FFM member in the internal e-mail.
The email in question is dated 22 June 2018 and therefore could not have been referring to the final OPCW report on Douma, which was released on 1 March 2019. In fact, the final report addresses all the points raised by the employee and addresses some of his/ her concerns. See here for a point-by-point disproof by Bellingcat.",REAL
888,ALL COUNTRIES USE DOPING,"SUMMARY
All athletes are dirty: we must have the facts that American athletes use it [doping], German athletes use it, French athletes use it. There’s no way one country is doing it and all the others are clean.

No evidence given. This is a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the World Anti-Doping Agency and the state-sponsored doping scheme of Russian athletes. The disinformation message is an example of ""whataboutism"": attempting to discredit an opponent’s position by accusing them of hypocrisy, typically with no  evidence.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has banned Russia from participating in major sport events for 4 years. The unanimous decision by WADA's executive committee was made after Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was declared uncompliant with the World Anti-Doping Code (Code) – the document harmonising anti-doping policies in all sports and in all countries.
It was not isolated instances of Russian athletes using doping that led to the ban, but rather ""the blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA’s reinstatement conditions"", which according to the head of WADA, ""demanded a robust response"". Read more here.",REAL

The unanimous decision by WADA's Executive Committee was made after Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was declared uncompliant with the World Anti-Doping Code (Code) – the document harmonising anti-doping policies in all sports and in all countries.

891,ZELENSKYY DOES NOT WANT TO ESTABLISH PEACE IN DONBAS,"SUMMARY
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy is simply mocking. See the frequency of some used words. It is special rhetoric when the words “occupied territories” are said so many times. The one who says this does it on purpose. This bastard is the same as Poroshenko or maybe even worse.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about the Minsk agreements and the War in Ukraine and the recent discussions in the “Normandy Four” format held in Paris.
During “Normandy Four” summit in Paris on 9 December 2019, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated that achieving peace in Donbas is the strategic priority of the Ukrainian government. In the communique that was signed by Ukraine, Germany, France, and the Russian Federation, the next security steps have been agreed, such as the “full and comprehensive implementation of the ceasefire”, “exchange of detainees […] based on the principle 'all for all'”, establishing “three additional disengagement areas”, establishing “new crossing points along the line of contact”, “the development and implementation of an updated de-mining plan”.
President Zelenskyy has been stressing on numerous occasions that his main strategic goal and the first and foremost task as the President is to achieve a peaceful settlement of the war in Donbas as soon as possible. For instance, on 13 October 2019, he underlined that “ending the war in Donbas” is a priority for the Ukrainian government.
To accomplish this task, Ukraine has fulfilled all preparatory steps, such as the withdrawal of troops on three sites, necessary to hold the meeting in the “Normandy format”. Moreover, in September Ukraine and Russia conducted the prisoner swap and agreed to exchange soon all prisoners. Ukraine had also agreed to sign the so-called Steinmeier formula which was again confirmed by President Zelenskyy on the “Normandy Four” summit.",REAL
892,WADA’S COLD WAR AGAINST RUSSIAN ATHLETES IS WESTERN REVENGE FOR THEIR TRIUMPHAL VICTORY IN THE 2014 WINTER OLYMPICS,"SUMMARY
Russia’s triumphal victory in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics made Americans and their allies worry about the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. They were tempted to use Crimea and Donbas events as a pretext to attack Russia through boycotting the Olympics but eventually decided to act through WADA, accusating Russia of purposeful doping policies. After 2014 a real anti-Russian “cold war” in sport has been waged. This war will be on at least until 2032 whatever the Russian anti-doping agency would do.
WADA’s attack has very little to do with combating doping. Instead, it aims at removing Russia as a strong sports competitor, pressing Vladimir Putin and the Russian government by demonstrating their alleged corruption and international isolation to the Russian population, and at humiliating Russia. There’s nothing more humiliating than athletes competing without national flag and anthem. Maybe they should also wear a prison uniform or a uniform with yellow stars as poor Jews in Nazi ghetto?
Members of WADA Executive Committee include representatives of the UK, Norway, Slovakia, Belgium, Turkey, Czechia, Italy, Poland, Australia, Sudan, and Ecuador. The representatives of the two latter countries are assigned a rather decorative role, whereas all the others are US allies. The Committee does not include members who have any independence from the US, thus allowing them to solve the problem. Russia should adopt an asymmetric response: to check if Russian law enforcement agencies have anything on the members of the WADA Executive Committee and to think of organizing alternative Olympic Games and World Championships.
DISPROOF
This is a mix of conspiract theories aimed to misrepresent the actual reasons behind the WADA's investigation and decision, which are consistent with a recurring pro-Kremlin narrative about the West's deliberate anti-Russian activities.
Earlier, the International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang in 2018 due to the systemic manipulation with anti-doping rules during the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi. Individual athletes from Russia competed under the Olympic flag. WADA reinstated Russia’s anti-doping agency in 2018 but reserved the right to issue stronger punishments if Russia did not provide athletes’ testing data from the Moscow laboratory. On 25 November 2019, one of WADA's key committees recommended that Russia face a four-year ban from global sports and new restrictions on its athletes and teams at next year’s Tokyo Olympics, subject to WADA's board review.
On 9 December 2019, the WADA's Executive Committee unanimously endorsed the recommendation made by the independent Compliance Review Committee that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency be declared non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code for a period of four years. “For too long, Russian doping has detracted from the clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of RUSADA’s reinstatement conditions, approved by the ExCo in September 2018, demanded a robust response. That is exactly what has been delivered today. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial. As a result, the WADA ExCo has responded in the strongest possible terms, while protecting the rights of Russian athletes that can prove that they were not involved and did not benefit from these fraudulent acts,"" WADA President Sir Craig Reedie said.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that there is no evidence that Russian athletes used doping, that banning Russia from the Olympics is a modern form of racism, that Russian athletes face sanctions because of Western Russophobia and Russia’s compliance, and that World Anti-Doping Agency recommendations are UK’s revenge for 2018 FIFA World Cup.",REAL

Russia argued that they were in Russian waters. However, a bilateral treaty between Russia and Ukraine, signed in 2003 and ratified by Russia in 2004, governs the use of the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov, which in the treaty is considered to be the “internal waters” of both Russia and Ukraine.
On 25 May 2019, the United Nations Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ordered Russia to immediately release Ukrainian sailors and allow them to return to Ukraine. The EU urged Russia to release the captured crew.

The EU’s message should not mislead anyone about the true meaning of this project [the Magnitsky sanctions]: to legitimise the right to intervene in the affairs of other states. These sanctions are a way to distract Europeans from internal problems.
DISPROOF
This case is part of the pro-Kremlin media's ongoing disinformation campaign against Magnitsky sanctions.
On 9 December 2019, EU foreign ministers reflected on how to improve the EU toolbox on human rights, and the EU High Representative Josep Borrell announced the launch of preparatory work on a possible horizontal sanctions regime to address serious human rights violations. In a statement, the EU's High Representative said: ""We have agreed to launch the preparatory work for a global sanctions regime to address serious human rights violations, which will be the European Union equivalent of the so-called Magnitsky Act of the United States"". He added that the sanctions would give the EU “much more strength and much more capacity to act” and would be “a tangible step reaffirming the EU’s global lead on human rights.”
In practice, Magnitsky sanctions target individuals around the world responsible for human rights violations or acts of significant corruption by imposing travel bans and freezes on their financial assets. The original Magnitsky Act was passed in the United States in 2012 to punish Russian nationals involved in the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky as well as other human rights violations, and was followed in 2017 by the Global Magnitsky Act, which extends to individuals anywhere in the world. Similar legislation has also been passed in the UK, Canada, and the Baltic States.
Sergei Magnitsky was a 37-year-old Russian lawyer and auditor who was tortured, denied medical care, and ultimately left to die in a Russian prison in 2009. He had uncovered a massive fraud scheme to the tune of $230 million that implicated several high-level state officials. A Russian investigation concluded that Magnitsky had died of natural causes; the case was then closed and Magnitsky was posthumously convicted of tax evasion. In August 2019, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Russian authorities “had deprived Sergei Magnitskiy of important medical care and had failed to comply with their duty to protect his life.” The judges unanimously concluded that Magnitsky's treatment in detention violated his human rights, the right to live, right to liberty and security, and right to freedom from torture.

898,"SECOND SREBRENICA TO HAPPEN IN DONBAS IF UKRAINE RECEIVES CONTROL OVER THE BORDER
","SUMMARY
In case Ukraine takes control over the border, the massacre [like the one] in Srebrenica might be repeated. I will just remind those who forgot: this is the bloodiest episode of the collapse of Yugoslavia; 8,000 dead in a few days in July [1995].
DISPROOF
The claim is unfounded and in line with the pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives on the situation in Ukraine and the war in Donbas.
The original claim was made on 9 December by the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, who warned that if Kyiv is granted control over the border with Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas, there would be a second Srebrenica.
Ukraine has been accused several times of committing genocide against ethnic Russians in Ukraine. Human rights missions that traveled to Ukraine in 2014 did not find evidence that the Russian minority would have been in danger. See, for instance, the Advisory Committee’s Ad hoc report on the situation of national minorities in Ukraine, adopted on 1 April 2014 by the Council of Europe; June 2014 report on the human rights situation in Ukraine by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; and the statement by the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities on her visit to Ukraine, published on 4 April 2014.
On the latter negotiations in the Normandy Format, Ukraine insisted that the political part of the Minsk agreements, such as elections, will be implemented only after Ukraine receives full control over the 450-km long border with Russia in Donbas.

899,AIM OF UN RESOLUTION ON MILITARISATION OF CRIMEA WAS TO INTERRUPT THE NORMANDY SUMMIT,"SUMMARY
The UN adopted an Ukrainian resolution of “militarization” of Crimea, which calls on Russia to withdraw its troops. The aim of the resolution was to interrupt the Normandy Four meeting. But UN is silent on militarisation of the region from the side of NATO.
DISPROOF
New take on the recurring pro-Kremlin narrative claiming that Crimea joined Russia legitimately. Also, consistent with the narrative that Ukraine is not interested in peace and that NATO is involved in the militarisation of the Black Sea region.
The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which urges the Russian Federation to withdraw its military forces from Crimea and end its temporary occupation of Ukraine’s territory without delay. It did not aim to interrupt the Normandy summit.
NATO's exercises and military deployments in the Black Sea are not directed against Russia – or any other country. NATO has reached out to Russia consistently, transparently and publicly over the past 29 years.Sea Breeze military exercises have been taking place each year since 1997, while Agile Spirit joint military exercises started in 2001 under a different name and were celebrated on a biennial base since then, so they can’t be considered a source of increased tensions.

902,EU HAS ACCEPTED CRIMEA’S INCORPORATION INTO RUSSIA,"SUMMARY
Zelenskyy was not able to discuss Crimea [during the Normandy summit], whose incorporation into Russia has therefore effectively been accepted by the EU.

More sanctions were imposed in response to the Syrian government’s support of international terrorism and violations against democratic and human rights in the country after the war began in 2011, and have been strengthened several times due to escalating violence in the region. 
On 27 May 2013, the Council of the EU adopted conclusions in which it condemned the violence and the continued widespread and systematic gross violations of human rights in Syria, the massacres committed by the Syrian armed forces and its militias, all instances of hostage-taking of peacekeepers, and the atrocities committed by the Syrian regime.

917,"WADA’S DOPING ACCUSATIONS, JUST LIKE SKRIPAL CASE AN THE DOWNING OF MH17 ARE RUSSOPHOBIC PROVOCATIONS","SUMMARY
Activities of WADA officials are theater of the absurd. Doping accusations has been turned into a weapon against Russia. The doping scandal should be seen as other Russophobic provocations including the Skripal case, MH17 downing and GRU base camp in the Alps.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Russophobia and West's deliberate anti-Russian activities.
Earlier, the International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang in 2018 due to the systemic manipulation of anti-doping rules during the Olympic Winter Games in Sochi. The individual athletes from Russia were allowed to compete under the Olympic flag. WADA reinstated Russia’s anti-doping agency in 2018 but reserved the right to issue stronger punishments if Russia did not provide athletes’ testing data from the Moscow laboratory. On 25 November 2019, one of WADA's key committees recommended that Russia face a four-year ban from global sports and new restrictions on its athletes and teams at next year’s Tokyo Olympics, subject to WADA's board review.
On 9 December 2019 the WADA's Executive Committee unanimously endorsed the recommendation made by the independent Compliance Review Committee that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency be declared non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code for a period of four years. “Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead a different route,"" WADA President Sir Craig Reedie said.
See earlier disinformation cases alleging that there is no evidence that Russian athletes used doping, that banning Russia from the Olympics is a modern form of racism, that Russian athletes face sanctions because of Western Russophobia and Russia’s compliance, and that World Anti-Doping Agency recommendations are UK’s revenge for 2018 FIFA World Cup.",REAL
918,ANGLO-SAXONS ARE STAGING A COLOUR REVOLUTION IN HONG KONG WITH ASSISTANCE FROM VATICAN AND UKRAINIAN NAZIS,"SUMMARY
Hong Kong has turned into a Western ‘Trojan horse’ in China. American security bodies sent Ukrainian Nazis to instruct Hong Kong protesters on how to organize a Chinese Maidan. Most of Ukrainian Nazi associations are sort of mobile private military companies serving the US State Department. Another probable goal behind sending Ukrainian Nazis is to bring discord between the Chinese government and Ukrainian oligarchs who started selling important military and scientific technologies to Chinese. Washington also brought the Vatican in to help with the organization of the Hong Kong maidan. Local Catholics began an open anti-government propaganda. Events in Hong Kong may provoke a chain reaction in other Chinese provinces and strengthen the activities of totalitarian sects. Furthermore, the Taiwanese leadership wants to seize power in the whole China with US secret assistance.
DISPROOF
This is a mix of Ukraine- and China-related conspiracies aimed to discredit Hong Kong protest movement, including recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about US or West-funded Hong Kong protests and Nazis in Ukraine.
Media widely reported about a group of four Ukrainians with far-right links noticed in Hong Kong, but the claims that they were sent by US security bodies or that they serve US State Department are groundless.
The  pro-Kremlin media frequently use disinformation narratives about popular protests allegedly incited by the US around the world, including colour revolutions in Eastern Europe, Euromaidan in Ukraine,  protests in Catalonia and others.
The protests in Hong Kong started in June 2019 over a controversial extradition law, but have expanded to call for Hong Kong's leader to step down, an inquiry into alleged police brutality, for those who have been arrested to be released and greater democratic freedoms.

919,NO TRUMP-RUSSIA CONSPIRACY HAS BEEN PROVEN,"SUMMARY
The private investigator, Robert Mueller, had investigated allegations of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia, and the so-called Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. He could not prove any of the accusations against the American president.  Despite this, the American intelligence services believe that Russia was also broadcasting misleading news on social media, to help elect Donald Trump.
DISPROOF
A recurring narrative of denials which Moscow has issued regarding its involvement in the 2016 presidential election in the United States and employs the long-established charge of Russophobia which the Kremlin uses to deflect criticism, however legitimate.
Before the Robert Mueller report was published, Russian meddling in the 2016 election had already been established by US intelligence agencies. Thus, the Special Investigation was primarily concerned with ""whether any Americans […] joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election"" (p.2).
Mueller makes clear in his report that ""collusion"" is not a legal concept under US federal law, and that gathering evidence thereof would have fallen outside the scope of the special counsel investigation (p. 2).
The aim of the probe was not merely to ascertain contacts between the Trump Campaign and Russia-linked individuals during the election period, but to establish whether these interactions were deliberate enough on the part of Trump Campaign officials to sustain charges of conspiracy (p. 2).
In fact, the report explicitly identifies ""numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"" (p. 9). A number of these individuals later ""made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct"" the probe (p. 180). The report's conclusions, therefore, do nothing to absolve the Russian government.
Regarding the exploitation of social media to interfere in the election, 13 Russian citizens have been criminally charged in the United States for conspiring to “sow discord in the U.S. political system,” including the 2016 presidential election.

936,EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION DISTORTS THE HISTORY OF WORLD WAR II,"SUMMARY
Not only Nazi collaborators but also respectable international institutions like the European Parliament continue to distort the history of World War II. The recent European Parliament resolution that equates Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union is an example of a blatant lie about World War II. The resolution almost accuses the Soviet Union of being responsible, along with Nazi Germany, for the outbreak of World War II, apparently forgetting that the Nazis invaded Poland on September 1st 1939 and attacked the Soviet Union on June 22nd 1941.
Those who question this brazen lie are even accused of conducting information warfare against Democratic Europe.
DISPROOF
Recurring disinformation narratives attempting to portray Russia's role in World War II as non-aggressive, to revise the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, reflecting the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and claiming that the recognition and denunciation of Stalinist crimes against humanity are Western anti-Russian propaganda.
The European Parliament is not distorting the history of World War II.The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe correctly states that “the Second World War, the most devastating war in Europe’s history, was started as an immediate result of the notorious Nazi-Soviet Treaty on Non-Aggression of 23 August 1939, also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and its secret protocols, whereby two totalitarian regimes that shared the goal of world conquest divided Europe into two zones of influence”.
In fact, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in complete occupation of the country by Germany and the USSR. The Treaty enabled the USSR to invade and annex the Baltic States. The Soviets also annexed Romania's provinces of Bessarabia (today's Moldova) and northern Bukovina (now in Ukraine) and the Czechoslovakian territory of Carpathian Ruthenia (now also part of Ukraine). Throughout the territories it occupied, the Soviet Union carried out harsh political reprisals, including mass executions and deportations
The resolution correctly argues that both Nazism and Stalinism were totalitarian regimes that carried out mass murder, genocide and deportation and caused the loss of life and freedoms in the 20th century on a scale unseen in human history, and recalls the horrific crime of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Nazi regime.
The resolution stresses that Russia remains the greatest victim of communist totalitarianism.
The concept of totalitarianism, which highlights the profound similarities between Nazism and Communism, is very widely accepted among contemporary political scientists and historians, including Russian scholars.
Read similar disinformation cases claiming that the European Parliament resolution is an ideological weapon against Russia that the European Parliament resolution’s statement about the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact has “nothing to do with history”   and that is not true that communist regimes killed 100 million persons.",REAL
937,MUELLER REPORT CONTAINS NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN 2016 US ELECTION,"SUMMARY
All accusations concerning Russia’s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election are speculative. The Mueller report contains no proof of collusion.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative denying Moscow's interference in the 2016 US presidential election and, by extension, other well-documented instances of such meddling in Western democracies (see the ""Electoral Interference"" tab).
Like multiple earlier claims made by pro-Kremlin outlets regarding the 2016 US election, the present story muddles the distinction between ""meddling""/""interference"" on the one hand and ""collusion"" on the other. By the time the Mueller report was published, Russian meddling in the 2016 poll had been established by the US intelligence community. The report itself concluded that Moscow had carried out this effort ""in sweeping and systematic fashion"" (p. 1).
Yet, collusion is ""not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in [US] federal criminal law,"" (p. 2) and therefore gathering evidence of it fell outside the scope of the Special Counsel investigation. The aim of the probe was not merely to ascertain contacts between the Trump Campaign and Russia-linked individuals during the election period, but to establish whether these interactions were deliberate enough on the part of Trump Campaign officials to sustain charges of conspiracy (ibid).
The report explicitly identifies ""numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign"" (p. 9).",REAL

President Trump’s “deep state” foes who are obsessed with doing anything that they can to thwart his desired rapprochement with Russia by encouraging Ukraine to continue the failed civil war as a proxy conflict against Moscow’s national security interests which they hope would indefinitely perpetuate the New Cold War. Trump is already facing enormous pressure by the so-called “opposition” as a result of the manufactured Ukrainegate impeachment scandal, and with the Democrats about to enter the primary season early next year, it’s entirely conceivable that their “deep state” allies might try to provoke the breakdown of the Donbas peace process in order to compel the President into offering even more military aid to Ukraine

939,ZIONIST MONEY ALREADY CORRUPTING THE 2020 ELECTIONS,"SUMMARY
The parasites in the shadows making a mockery out of representative democracy have good reason to be confident: they are already starting to corrupt the 2020 elections. Open Secrets analyzed the most recent donor data for the top 10 political donors going into next year’s first quarter. Unsurprisingly, 8 out of 10 of these fat cats are Jews.

940,EP RESOLUTION ON MOLOTOV-RIBBENTROP PACT IS A MANIFESTATION OF WESTERN ANTI-RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES,"SUMMARY
The Resolution of the EU Parliament from September 18 [regarding the role of the USSR in the start of WWII] is a manifestation of anti-Russian activities. It is a part of the anti-Russian policy, which has been particularly present in Western Europe since the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis. Possibly, if there was no crisis in Ukraine, this resolution wound not have existed. It is clear that this resolution on historical issues has a connection to the present day and to the current relations between Western Europe and Russia.
DISPROOF
This message is part of the Kremlin’s policy of historical revisionism and an attempt to portray Russia's role in World War II as not aggressive. The pro-Kremlin media actively spread various disinformation messages referring to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
The European Parliament resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe stressed the fact that WWII was an immediate result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The resolution is aimed at the promotion of historical remembrance about WWII and condemnation of totalitarian ideologies.
It is a proven historical fact that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact contained the Secret Supplementary Protocol, which assumed the division of Poland and other Eastern European countries between the USSR and Germany. Thus, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact enabled the German and Soviet military aggression against Poland in September 1939, which resulted in the occupation of this country by Germany and USSR, triggering the beginning of WWII.
See similar examples of the Russian historical revisionism concerning this issue - Signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact thwarted the UK’s expansionist plans in Europe, The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact did not violate the rights of the Polish state, The shift of all blame for WWII outbreak at the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact the best example of manipulation of history.",REAL

947,MH17 INVESTIGATION IS BIASED,"SUMMARY
The MH17 tragedy is being actively as a pretext of informational campaign against Russia. Russia was blamed from the very beginning – just few hours after the crash. Тhe investigation is inquisitional. Russia is always being blamed for everything, including this disaster. Russia was not allowed to take part in the investigation, despite the mentioning a number of factors that need to be clarified. But no one responded to the numerous calls of Russia.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative undermining the Joint International Investigation of the downing of the flight  MH17.
A special team, known as the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), was established to conduct the criminal investigation of the downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. The JIT comprises officials from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service and the Dutch police, along with police and criminal justice authorities from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine.
The JIT has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters. The BUK-TELAR was brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation and subsequently, after having shot down flight MH17, was taken back to the Russian Federation. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT), has concluded that the BUK-TELAR used to down MH17, originates from the 53rd Anti Aircraft Missile brigade, a unit of the Russian army from Kursk in the Russian Federation.
In September 2016, the JIT disclosed that MH17 was downed with a BUK missile of the 9M38 series. In Eastern Ukraine, two parts of such a missile were found. These parts are the so-called ‘venturi’ and the ‘casing’. This regards, on the one hand, the exhaust of the missile (venturi) and on the other hand the casing of the missile engine (casing). The missile engine’s casing shows the number 9 д 1318869032. The JIT-investigation up to now has found that 9д 131 relates to the number of the missile engine of the 9M38 type and/or 9M38M1 type. The number 8 is the manufacturer’s code, namely: the Dolgoprudny Research and Manufacturing Enterprise in Moscow. The number 86 indicates the year of production, namely 1986. And the number 9032 is the unique identification number of this specific missile engine.
The European Union and NATO have called on the Russian Federation to accept its responsibility and to fully cooperate with all efforts to establish accountability. On the basis of the JIT’s conclusions, the Netherlands and Australia are convinced that Russia is responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation that was used to down MH17. The two governments are formally holding Russia accountable. The US has supported the decisions by the Netherlands and Australia.",REAL
948,"NORMANDY SUMMIT RESULTS: THE EU PLAYS ON RUSSIA’S SIDE AND BETRAYED KYIV, NO BRIGHT FUTURE FOR UKRAINE
","SUMMARY
Ukraine has put itself in a situation when external forces dictate how it should solve its internal problems. Kyiv expected that its Western allies will put pressure on Russia in the Normandy Four format. However, the allies realised that their confrontation with Russia will cost them more. Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel supported Russia’s position and put even bigger pressure on Ukraine than Vladimir Putin did. Eventually Zelenskyy found himself in solitude, because Russia, Germany, and France had nearly identical positions regarding the resolution of the civil conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian politicians wrongfully remain confident that the West will always unconditionally support any Russophobic regime and that Ukraine can just carry out its foreign policy and security under the West’s authority to enjoy its protection.
Ukraine could slam the door and declare that it no longer needs the Normandy format. However, it is the last remaining material evidence of Ukraine’s unity with the West and of its “movement” towards Europe, which Kyiv can present to the Ukrainian people. If the truth is told to the Ukrainians that Europe, represented by Paris and Berlin, is already playing along with Russia, then Ukrainian people will reasonably question, for what were people sacrificed and state and society destroyed, if in the end, Europe betrayed Ukraine, Ukraine will never be in the EU, and a “bright future” will never come.
DISPROOF
This article misrepresents the actual German and French positions in the Normandy summit and masks the clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014 as Ukraine's ""internal problems"" and ""civil conflict"". It also challenges Ukrainian statehood and sovereignty and promotes recurring pro-Kremlin propagandistic narrative about Ukraine's inevitable bleak future, its disintegration and imminent collapse.
The claim that Germany and France play along with Russia is groundless. According to the Common Agreed Conclusions of the Normandy summit of 9 December 2019, ""The Minsk agreements (Minsk Protocol of 5 September 2014, Minsk Memorandum of 19 September 2014 and the Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015) continue to be the basis of the work of the Normandy format whose member states are committed to their full implementation."" The Minsk Package of Measures of 12 February 2015, among other things, without mentioning Russian personnel and hardware by name, calls for the ""withdrawal of all foreign armed formations, military equipment, as well as mercenaries from the territory of Ukraine under monitoring of the OSCE"" (para 10).
Read our articles about anti-Ukrainian propaganda Ukraine Under Information Fire and Five Years of Falsehoods: Was it Worth the While for the Kremlin? as well as earlier disinformation cases claiming that Ukraine invariably faces civil war and complete disintegration, that Ukraine will be disintegrated by 2023, that the Normandy summit aimed at solving Ukraine’s internal problems, and that Germany fabricated a new “Skripal case” ahead of Normandy summit.",REAL

American authorities intentionally terminated the INF treaty under the pretext that Russia violated the agreement. However, Moscow rejects all allegations. The test of the forbidden rocket proves that the Americans sought to terminate the agreement. So, Americans deliberately failed the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative claiming that the US is entirely responsible for the demise of the INF treaty.
Russia bears primary responsibility for the end of the INF Treaty, because it has produced, tested and deployed the 9M729 missile, which violates the agreement. In July 2014, the then-US President Obama officially accused Russia of testing a missile in violation of the INF Treaty, which prohibits the US or Russia from possessing, producing or test-flying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of between 500 and 5500 kilometres.
In a joint statement released after the meeting held at NATO Headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday 4 and Wednesday 5 December 2018, NATO Foreign Ministers stated that “Allies have concluded that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security.""

Populism is a revolt against liberal-globalist domination. It is a protest against, and rejection of, the status-quo and the establishment. Right-wing populism fights for the defence of traditional values (family, normal relationships between the sexes, nation, church, roots and identity), which are under extinction and are being annihilated. Left-wing populism struggles for the rights of workers and for social justice against capitalists. Liberal-globalist élites, Soros, globalists, bankers, the EU, all élites aim to keep right-wing and left-wing populism separate, to prevent an alliance between them.

961,"NATO AND EU ARE ACTIVELY FABRICATING RUSSOPHOBIA IN THE BALTIC STATES TO JUSTIFY THEIR ANTI-RUSSIAN POLICIES
","SUMMARY
The interests of the NATO and EU powers in the Baltic States are determined by the geographical situation and the possibilities to use the Baltic States as a disruptive factor against peaceful conditions of cooperation and understanding in the region and in neighbourly relations with Russia.
The powers of NATO and the EU are actively interfering in the shaping of internal relations of the Baltic States; their focus is on the creation of “fear of the Baltic towards the Russians”. This fear can be instrumentalised externally for the goals of the NATO and EU powers for the control of Baltic States against Russia. An enemy image of Russia is created. The effect on the cultivation of Russophobia is achieved through the systematic fomenting of internal political contrasts between different nationalities. The Western powers need this atmosphere of fear and instability to justify their anti-Russian policies.
Especially after the accession of the Baltic states to NATO and the EU, the West has shown that it is determined to further develop this geographical area on Russia’s western borders and to actively use it for its geopolitical goals. The nature of these measures, as well as the military-political steps, show that its policy towards Russia is increasingly degenerating towards military confrontation. For the Baltic Sea and its neighbours and for Europe, this means increasing militarisation and the danger of war.
DISPROOF
Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Russophobia in Lithuania and the Baltic States. Also consistent with a recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about NATO encircling Russia.
For more than two decades, NATO has worked to build a partnership with Russia, developing dialogue and practical cooperation in areas of common interest. Cooperation has been suspended since 2014 in response to Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine but political and military channels of communication remain open. Concerns about Russia’s continued destabilising pattern of military activities and aggressive rhetoric go well beyond Ukraine. Read more about NATO - Russia relations here.

962,"THE NATO PUPPET REGIME IN KYIV ACTS ONLY IN THE INTEREST OF NATO, NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF UKRAINE
","SUMMARY
The NATO puppets in charge of Ukraine do not act in the interests of Ukraine, but in the interests of NATO, and, until that changes, peace for the Donbass remains a distant hope.
DISPROOF
Recurrent pro-Kremlin narrative, challenging Ukrainian statehood. For example, pro-Kremlin media has claimed that Ukraine has become a vassal of Germany and Ukraine is under US control.
Ukraine is a sovereign state. Neither the US nor NATO controls Ukraine. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity continue to be violated by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces since February 2014.",REAL
963,A NEW UNION OF JOURNALISTS FOR “INDEPENDENT MEDIA” ESTABLISHED IN FINLAND,"SUMMARY
A new Union of Journalists for alternative – a better description would be independent – media established in Finland.
DISPROOF
The context: The actual Union of Journalists in Finland (UJF), www.journalistiliitto.fi, , has nearly 15 000 members who work for the print media, broadcasting, publishing and new communications media. It is an independent trade union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements. It works to further the financial, social and professional standing of its members, both salaried and freelancers. The union does not belong to but cooperates with trade union confederations.
The copycat NGO has been registered officially within the Finnish Register of Associations in 2016 with the name ""Suomen vapaa sana riippumaton toimittajayhdistys ry"". However, this Union imitates the UJF URL address (www.journalistiliitto.com), . Vice-chair of the copycat organisation is also MV-lehti's editor-in-chief, a Finn who resided for years in occupied Donetsk and ran a propaganda media operation there. In the ""About"" section of the website the war in Ukraine is described as a ""civil war"", which is recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation. See the archived version of the web page here.
Twitter has suspended the account of the copycat organisation.

The war in eastern Ukraine was provoked by Russia. The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has stated that “[t]he information available suggests that the situation within the territory of Crimea and Sevastopol amounts to an international armed conflict between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This international armed conflict began at the latest on 26 February when the Russian Federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the Ukrainian territory without the consent of the Ukrainian Government.”
The European Union stated in July 2014 that ""arms and fighters continue flowing into Ukraine from the Russian Federation"".
At the NATO Summit in Wales in September 2014, NATO leaders condemned Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine in the strongest terms and demanded that Russia stop and withdraw its forces from Ukraine and along the country’s border. NATO leaders also demanded that Russia comply with international law and its international obligations and responsibilities; end its illegitimate occupation of Crimea; refrain from aggressive actions against Ukraine; halt the flow of weapons, equipment, people and money across the border to the separatists; and stop fomenting tension along and across the Ukrainian border.
According to the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Russian special forces and troops operated to mobilise, lead, equip, and support separatist militias in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine from spring 2014 to the present, although their presence was denied by Moscow.

1001,"Hong Kong Protests: Fading Foreign Tantrum, Not Genuine Revolution","Just as unfolded in 2014 during the so-called “Umbrella protests” or “Occupy Central” movement, a growing backlash has begun across Hong Kong against US-funded protests that have attempted to disrupt governance and commerce as part of a floundering movement to maintain Western influence in the region.
The Sydney Morning Herald in its article, “Triads linked to violent pro-China gangs as Hong Kong protests enter dangerous new phase,” ignored weeks of violence carried out by US-backed protests in Hong Kong, and portrayed locals retaliating as “violent pro-China gangs.” It should be pointed out that Hong Kong is in China.
The article claims:
Turbulence in Hong Kong has reached a dangerous new phase, analysts say, amid escalating violence and the failure of Chief Executive Carrie Lam to respond to the political crisis. 
Television broadcasts on Monday were dominated by scenes of white-shirted men believed to be triad members caning and chasing train commuters as they hunted for democracy protesters on Sunday evening. People screamed as the gangs entered train carriages at Yuen Long station.
Having failed to attract wider public support, US-backed protesters have begun resorting to increasingly disruptive activities including raiding government buildings, storming commercial districts to intimidate visitors from mainland China and even targeting public transportation.
Backlash Follows Weeks of Violence and Vandalism by Pro-Western Protests
Before the SMH’s “violent pro-China gangs” showed up, US-backed protesters had admittedly stormed Hong Kong’s Legislative Council (LegCo) building. The BBC in its article, “Hong Kong police evict protesters who stormed parliament,” admitted:
Activists had occupied the Legislative Council (LegCo) building for hours after breaking away from a protest on the anniversary of Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty to China from Britain.
The BBC also admitted the protesters carried out vandalism inside the building:
Inside, they defaced the emblem of Hong Kong in the central chamber, raised the old British colonial flag, spray-painted messages across the walls, and shattered furniture.
The Financial Times in their article, “Hong Kong protesters target Chinese government office,” mentioned another government building targeted by the protesters, the Liaison Office for Hong Kong representing Beijing. The article reported:
Demonstrators spray-painted over the lenses of security cameras in front of the building and one threw an egg that splattered on its glass facade. Others wrote graffiti on a wall including an insult against China, and defaced lettering on the building’s gate.
The Guardian attempted to conceal the nature of the protests in its article, “Hong Kong protest ends in chaotic clashes between police and demonstrators,” which was ultimately about protesters targeting a shopping centre popular with mainland visitors.
The article would claim:
Violent clashes have erupted between Hong Kong police and protesters at the end of a peaceful demonstration against the controversial extradition bill. The incidents took place late on Sunday in a bustling town between Hong Kong island and the border with China. The scene descended into chaos shortly before 10pm local time (1400 GMT), after riot police chased protesters into a shopping centre in Sha Tin.
However, the Financial Times in its article, “Hong Kong protesters try to woo Chinese tourists to their cause,” admitted the protesters intentionally targeted the shopping centre rather than merely being “chased into it.” The article admits:
Hong Kong protesters against a controversial extradition bill for the first time targeted a busy shopping district popular with mainland Chinese tourists in an attempt to raise awareness of the issue across the border.
A recently built high-speed train station connecting Hong Kong with mainland China was also targeted. AFP-JIJI in its article, “Hong Kong protesters march on station to get message across to visiting Chinese mainlanders,” would admit:
Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters on Sunday rallied outside a controversial train station linking the territory to the Chinese mainland, the latest mass show of anger as activists try to keep pressure on the city’s pro-Beijing leaders. 
The US-backed protesters have also targeted journalists. The New York Times in its article, “Hong Kong Protesters’ New Target: A News Station Seen as China’s Friend,” attempted to defend the targeting of journalists perceived as being “pro-Beijing” claiming:
The confrontation on Wednesday, when the TVB journalist was surrounded, was not an isolated incident. Last month, protesters heckled another TVB video journalist, unfurling umbrellas to block his camera and chanting, “TVB news, selling out the people of Hong Kong!”
The New York Times fails to mention that opposition media is almost exclusively funded and supported from abroad, particularly out of Washington DC. If Beijing has no say or influence in Hong Kong, territory literally within its own borders, what say does Washington have so many thousands of miles away?
Together, the increasingly disruptive behaviour of the protesters coupled with growing violence and overt endorsement and even support being provided by the United States and other foreign interests, are attempting to target and impact virtually every aspect of life in Hong Kong linked to stability, peace and prosperity.
If the United States cannot maintain Hong Kong as its foothold inside Chinese territory and enjoy the benefits of its prosperity, no one else will either.
Hong Kong is China 
The government of Hong Kong is elected by both the people and organisations representing influential business communities there. The government is overwhelmingly pro-Beijing because Hong Kong is now firmly part of China. It was handed back to China in 1997 by the UK after over 170 years of British subjugation.
An influx of mainlanders, major infrastructure projects and flourishing business between the former British colony and China’s mainland has begun the irreversible re-integration of Hong Kong back into China.
Notions including “Basic Law” and “one country, two systems” were imposed on Beijing which at the time still lacked the political, economic and military power it now possesses. Both Basic Law and the “one country, two systems” arrangement were imposed on Beijing by London specifically as a means of technically handing Hong Kong over, but in practice, maintaining Western influence and the region’s role as Anglo-American foothold within Chinese territory.
As British influence across Asia-Pacific waned over time, Washington took over. Core leaders of Hong Kong’s ongoing protests against Beijing are funded and directed by Washington with many of these leaders, including Martin Lee, Joshua Wong and Benny Tai having literally travelled to Washington to receive support and even awards for their continuously disruptive behaviour.
Beijing has patiently weathered the West’s disruptive activities within its territory. In addition to Hong Kong, the US has nurtured separatism and terrorism in China’s Xinjiang region as well as armed insurrection and separatism in Tibet that has spanned more than half a century.
All of this is part of an admittedly decades-long strategy of encircling and containing China’s rise as a global power in order to preserve American primacy.
China’s answer has been meeting US-backed identity politics designed to divide and destroy, with massive infrastructure, education and economic programmes that have clearly gained the upper-hand even in places like Hong Kong where Western influence has been so deeply entrenched.
When faced with the choice of political instability or infrastructure and economic prosperity, the choice is very simple for the people of not only Hong Kong, but also Xinjiang and Tibet.
It is no wonder residents in Hong Kong have responded negatively to the violence and disruption perpetrated by US-backed protesters. The majority of Hong Kong has nothing to gain from disrupting commerce, targeting infrastructure, blocking roads and the vandalism of public property especially considering why it is really being done.
It is not being done for the people of Hong Kong or the nation of China of which Hong Kong once again now belongs. It is being done for Washington and is just one small part of a much wider, global slash-and-burn foreign policy. The protests in Hong Kong are also part of that policy failing. As US primacy fades across the globe, Washington has resorted to increasingly desperate and spiteful acts of destabilisation, as seen in Hong Kong.
The protests have no future in Hong Kong. They are led by an increasingly unpopular minority backed by a fading global power, and fighting against a growing global colossus within its own borders. The only real question is; how much damage will Washington and its proxies do as they throw this final tantrum?",FAKE
1002,Debunking Lies And Myths About The So-Called ‘Soviet-German Pact’ ,"MOSCOW – September 17th marked 80 years since Soviet troops retook western Belarus and western Ukraine, which were previously occupied by Poland. The Polish Army went for a landgrab after the turmoil of WW1, during which Russia lost massive territories. Much later, in 1939, Hitler’s Germany invaded Poland on September 1st, despite the fact that Poland had a pact of “Eternal Friendship” with Hitler. It’s worth noting this pact came in early 1934, that is, mere months after Hitler took power in Germany.
At the time, Nazi Germany was relatively weak militarily. The Wehrmacht was even behind France, Germany’s primary adversary in Western Europe and way behind Russia, which at the time had the most powerful military in the world. By the late 1930s, Poland still held true to its alliance with Hitler, which also included a very favorable trade agreement. That is, favorable for the Third Reich as Germany was getting the much-needed resources from Poland.
The alliance culminated in the joint Polish-German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938 (some would call this invasion the real start of the WW2), which was okayed by the UK and France. The capture of Czechoslovakia, which at the time had a highly sophisticated arms industry, gave Hitler the opportunity to almost double the size of his army by mid-1939. But let’s ignore that “trivial fact” and put all the blame on the “evil Russians” which were trying to form an anti-nazi alliance since the moment Hitler took power in 1933. The USSR fought the Nazis during the 1930s, including during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). It was only after multiple British and French refusals to establish an anti-nazi alliance that the Russians have had enough of Western shenanigans and signed the Soviet-German Nonaggression Pact. Now, it should be understood that a nonaggression pact is in no way an alliance, as the rabid Russophobic propaganda would like everyone to think. It’s just what its very name says – a pact in which both parties agree to sign a legally binding document which states they are not to attack each other.
And indeed, seeing how the Wehrmacht ripped through the whole of Europe in mere months, Stalin wanted to avoid a direct confrontation, because he considered the Red Army was still not ready for such a war because the USSR was undergoing a massive military reform which would’ve made the Red Army the most powerful military force in the world by 1942/1943. Hitler knew about this and wanted to invade Russia as soon as possible in order to avoid having to face an even more powerful Russia. The rest is a well-known part of our grim world’s history.
Around 600,000 Soviet soldiers died fighting Nazism and liberating Poland from their murderous oppressors, putting an end to the Nazi killing spree, which stopped at 6 million Polish citizens killed (over 20% of the population). And this Nazi killing spree was stopped only due to the unimaginable war efforts of the Red Army and the USSR, which lost an absolutely staggering 27 million people. And now, those efforts are being denigrated and put on par with the Nazi aggressor. No government system is perfect but despite its many flaws, comparing communism to Nazi oppression and genocide is immoral at best. Still, this is exactly what has been going on for quite some time, and especially in Eastern Europe, which was an area that suffered the most under Nazi rule.
Despite all this, historical revisionism and rabid Russophobia are as rampant as ever. And not just in the traditionally Russophobic countries, like Poland or the Baltic states. Washington (and to a large degree Brussels) are engaged in fostering this hatred so as to not just create a bulwark against the mythical “Russian aggression”, but also a possible staging ground for another “Barbarossa”. Of course, just like in 1938 when they were using Czechs as a bargaining chip, it’s not a big issue for the West to use modern Eastern Europeans as cannon fodder in a possible future confrontation with Russia, leaving the West unscathed. However, this time, it would be quite different as more than 6,000 Russian nukes disagree.",FAKE
1003,Even when such was not Poroshenko: Ukraine's economy as the output from the peak,"While the new Ukrainian government is discussing priorities, every minute of leaving the country two citizens. Otgremeli Zelensky first hundred days, all the required destination, and the team of the new president seems to be firmly set to work. And it was known what the priorities set for the Rada. Several of them. Within a month MPs should start discussing and accordingly approve the production of amber, legalized after 10 years of prohibition of gambling business, it has a casino, and, finally, the most controversial bill - is preparing to repeal the moratorium on sale of agricultural land. This ban came in the Ukraine even during the reign of President Leonid Kuchma, in 2001, and still remained extremely painful.
Land in Ukraine - it is now the most valuable and, perhaps, the last interesting asset for investors. Human capacity there is almost no more - all on earnings in Europe, oil and gas there, but the Ukrainian black soil - a very tasty morsel, which for a long time are looking at both European and American monopolies.
The first meeting of the new Cabinet Zelensky and security forces - in stand up comedy and traditional style. An occasion for jokes made the young Premier Alexey Goncharuk.
""I wanted to make a joke about the scooter, but we have a serious meeting,"" - said Zelensky.
""And I wanted to come on a scooter, but also changed his mind,"" - said Alexey Goncharuk.
Then no laughing matter. Zelensky suggests how to bring the country out of the economic peak. It demands to cancel the moratorium on land sales: ""To develop and submit to parliament a draft law on agricultural land market and to abolish the moratorium on land sales.""
Many could not believe their ears. The world's breadbasket Ukraine is ready to abandon his main asset of the highest quality - black earth.
""His attempt to sell the land - a task that put the Ukrainian oligarchy, Kolomoisky,"" - said political analyst Yuri Kot.
The moratorium was acting 14 years. Radical Oleg Lyashko advises farmers to take up pitchforks, because axiom is simple: lack of a ban equal to a total sale of land where the owner is not exactly become ordinary Ukrainian. Even when such was not Poroshenko.
""We have to be either a fool or a criminal, to last the wealth, which remains at the Ukrainian nation, to sell"", - says Oleg Lyashko, leader of the Radical Party of Ukraine.
Apparently, the new Kiev government in a hurry to turn the natural heritage into merchandise and sell Western partners in exchange for another billion from the IMF. But more recently, Zelensky promised to demand renegotiation of lending, and in the movie ""The servant of the people"" and does the IMF sent away for a long time. But one thing - a movie, and the other - the life and the country mired in debt.
""Foreign companies will acquire land. They will be able to get cheap land, will grow oilseed rape, etc. "", - said the head of the Political Economy Research Center, political scientist Vasily Koltashov.
Oppositionist Rabinovich, from the rostrum of Parliament reminds the team Zelensky, which promised maximum transparency to the people, that would be nice to ask the opinion of Ukrainians: ""Before introducing the sale of land, servants of the people should be consulted with the owner, with the Ukrainian people."" It is possible that soon for the sake of the IMF's new government to be auctioned and strategic enterprises - Zelensky has promised to start a large-scale privatizations in 2019. Another anti-crisis solution: legalize the production of amber and turn the country into one big casino.
""We legalize gambling - namely, the casino in five-star hotels,"" - said the Ukrainian president.
All these developments should help the poorest country in Europe, according to the IMF, to revive the economy. In fact it's more like trying to warm up by the stoves, burning an expensive antique furniture.
""What Zelensky promises a miracle, no, it will not. The crisis will make the poor people even more, ""- said the head of the Political Economy Research Center, political scientist Vasily Koltashov.
But even now, according to statistics, every minute of Ukraine leaving two people. Most breaks in Poland, taking by storm the border. They run from the Ukraine in search of a new promised land. As a result, plow, not straightening his back, from sunrise to sunset, but still receive from the pans slap. To understand the scale of the relocation of the Ukrainians in Poland, do not need no dry statistics. Simply go to the center every Polish city and listen to what languages ​​are spoken by the working people: construction workers at numerous construction sites, waiters in restaurants, street barker. In addition to Polish, more often you will hear Russian and Ukrainian speech.
But it seems that the patience of the Poles, where we arrived more than two million migrant workers crowded for a better life. Annoying migrants from the East do not want to take the job, calling ""nedolyudmi"" in supermarkets broadcast signs warning that all Ukrainians waiting for examination at the checkout. However, some supermarket. Ukrainians are usually purchased on the market so-called delay on the outskirts of Warsaw and share their experience, the best way to cook eggplant saute of rotten and what soak rotten meat. But it's flowers. Alena Romanenko from Lutsk worked in the Polish facilities. When her hand tightened in the ironing machine, pan host forbidden rescuers spoil prized possessions. He had cut his hand Alena.
""The pain was terrible. And when rescuers would cut machine, laundry owner said that this can not be done categorically "", - he explained to the victim.
That pans boiling, clear even arrived. A wave of anti-Ukrainian demonstrations covered the Polish cities. Posters - in large letters: ""Ukrainian not my brother."" Organizers of the protests say intruders, agreeing to work for nothing, will soon be left without work Poles themselves.
""Ukrainians too much, and they've really become a problem. Let them go home, ""- said Lukasz Buzhinskiy, member of the organization"" National Radical Camp. ""
From poor neighbors from the East of the Poles and the truth is nothing but trouble. Zarobitchane were being taken to a virus of measles. The epidemic has covered the Ukraine. Now alarming reports of cases - and in the Polish television.
""It is not our measles, she was brought. In Ukraine, 25 thousand cases since the beginning of the year, but because they are moved around the world, ""- says Paul Gzhesevsky, an employee fund"" Institute for the prevention of infectious diseases ""in Poland.
However, its neighbors Ukraine regularly delivers not only viruses - weapons. Belarusian authorities have sounded the alarm.
""We had to close the border with loved ones, completely close the border"", - said President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Criminal chronicles Square full of showdowns with the use of illegal weapons. But there are only small caches, wholesalers do not touch. On a special website has everything from Kalashnikov assault rifles to grenade launchers. With photos, prices. Note: shipping to EU countries. For the inhabitants of Kiev - discount. For example, everyone who buys a weapon - 50 rounds for free. As if shoes or dress you choose. Weapons of ATO zone, almost openly, and driven by volunteers, themselves fighters of the Ukrainian army.
""Today, from 4 to 5 million barrels in the illicit traffic,"" - said Oleg Zhdanov, retired colonel, former officer of the operational management of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces of Ukraine.
In the life of the president Zelensky really everything was much more complicated than in the movies. Legacy of Poroshenko - the cargo is not an easy task. And how to pull the country without a loss, confused over the years all their wealth, even people infested armed to the teeth nationalists, mired in debt, and in fact the peak of payments will have just the presidency Zelensky - do not know, perhaps, no expert.
Against this background, the Sabbath exchange retained persons - the only clearly the right move for a world that will add points to the newly elected president.",FAKE

1011,POP-ECOFASCISM FROM U.N. TRIBUNE,"Stupidity costs little, but yields much. It is the art of giving and accepting simple and incorrect explanations of complex things. The phenomenon of Greta Thunberg is not in the fact of her speech in the UN, but rather in the new propaganda trend, it marks. Children and fools are ready to tell anything as well as their adult and clever patrons. However, it becomes more and more apparent the propaganda of values of the New World Order has become totalitarian. Instead of soft power, its agents are now focusing on the promotion of their ideas with the hard power.
On September 23, the 16-year-old ‘climate activist’ from Sweden, Greta Thunberg, spoke at the UN Climate Action Summit blamed world leaders for ‘failing to address climate change’. The mentally ill girl has been for a long time one of the leading PR projects run by agents of the disdainful, unelected and defiant global bureaucracy in the field of environment-related questions.
The entire speech of Greta Thunberg in the UN consisted of stupidity, affectation and a poor acting. The girl is just the most recent of childs used by the global elites to pursue own goals. Her image is similar to those of infamous Bana al-Abed (the girl used by mainstream media and al-Qaeda terrorists for their propaganda campaigns during the battle for the Syrian city of Aleppo). Besides this Greta Thunberg declared an idea (provided by some ghostwritter) that the past generations of “stealing her dreams and childhood”. This hypocritical statement made by the girl born in the state with one of the best social security in the World is a demonstration of disrespect and disdain towards billion of people living the Asia, Africa and other complicated parts of the world.
The distorted face and psychopathic manners of Greta Thunberg caused a negative response even from those who still treated the young eco-activist relatively positively. The term “pop-ecofascism” looks to be very useful to describe the ideas promoted by masterminds behind the ill girl. These ideas declare the readiness to sacrifice lives of people and use terrorism-like methods to achieve own ‘environment-related’ goals.
Even people that support the need to ‘do something’ with ‘ecology problems’ have a pretty sceptic view towards the new mainstream icon because her image of uneducated fanatic discredits the work needed to be done to solve the existing environment issues. Some even speculate that the girl is used to discredit ‘green movements’. However, most likely, the Greta Thunberg project is just a sign of the brave new world, which the globalists seek to create. At the same time, the unelected global bureaucracy pursuses some practical goals with their new tool. They seek:
To expand the number of linked entities and persons and integrate them even further into existing government and non-government organizations;
To gain additional funding from government and international organizations that are ‘concerned’ by the current state of environment and challenges existing in the field. The hysteria over the topic will also give additional opportunities to make money for the already existing organizations.
To consolidate and strengthen a new tool to pressure national states and their national industry.
It would be wrong to deny some existing problems in the field of environment. However, the existing situation is being mystified and overestimated for political purposes. The media hysteria ignores that, for example, in the field of discharge into the air the situation in 2019 is better than it was 20-30 years ago. The stagnation of the industrial production around the world cannot contribute to the increase of issues in this field. The motor vehicle emissions issue is also much easier than it was previously because of the increased safety standards and the mass introduction of electric cars to the market. Probably, the only environment issue, which has become more complex over the past years, is the garbage question: daily waste (mostly plastic) and waste from the utilization of household appliances and similar equipment. However, national states contribute active efforts to deal with these problems. ",FAKE
1013,"Washington will present the Republic of Moldova on a silver platter ""head"" Plahotniuc: Is it feasible scenario","After returning from the US Sandu head of the parliamentary commission of inquiry into ""theft of the century"" Slusar revealed the names of the principal beneficiaries of appearing in the Kroll report What binds the United States, ""theft of the century"" and the fugitive oligarch?
Is this a coincidence or not, but immediately after his return from Washington, the government delegation Maia Sandu, head of the parliamentary commission of inquiry into ""theft of the century"" Alexander Slusar revealed the names of the main beneficiaries, appearing in the American company Kroll report.
All roads lead to Washington
How then admitted itself the prime minister, in the United States also conducted negotiations on the return of assets of persons involved in financial fraud, and mentioned the name of the fugitive oligarch. Last but not least, the ocean discussed the payment of citizens billions stolen from the financial system of Moldova. Not everyone knows, but the question of repayment of the population of the giant country to sums stolen from banks is not solved by Chisinau, namely Washington.
And after the theft billion theme was ""warmed up"" by politicians, the media has more details to escape from Moldova Vlad Plahotniuc. Some sources told reporters that in Chisinau reportedly arrived several groups of special forces soldiers from foreign countries. They were tasked to arrest any oligarch or eliminate it. And that, fearing for his life, the former ""boss of Moldova"" ran through Transnistria, where he was expected to head bodyguard Poroshenko. And the whole operation Plahotniuc evacuation was carried out with the support of US intelligence. The leadership of this country has provided certain guarantees Plahotniuc, and the oligarch went to his luxurious residence in Miami.
If we keep in mind that the Kroll company with which the Moldovan authorities have concluded a contract for the investigation of financial fraud, is an American, then for istorieys flight oligarch, ""theft of the century"" constantly, like a shadow, the US presence.
In the US, Moldova monitor all
In fact, the presence of the US in all political processes in Moldova, in the affairs of government, banking, NGO activity and the media should be no surprise.
After April pogroms in 2009 Washington's role in all spheres of the Moldovan society has increased considerably. Yes, and by the events, according to the ex-president Vladimir Voronin, was involved in a skillful organizer of the ""color revolutions"", representative of the US National Democratic Institute Alex Grigorevs. He was arrested by the Moldovan authorities directly in the NDI office in Chisinau and expelled from the country for their involvement in the riots.
And after the Wikileaks website published a leak of diplomatic correspondence of the former US ambassador to Chisinau, Asif Chaudhry, even began to go jokes about Moldovan politicians and US diplomats. After all, it was reported that senior officials went to the American embassy as a kbatyushke to confession. And in late 2009, as evidenced by the Wikileaks leaks, acting President Mihai Ghimpu was seriously alarmed the US diplomat as saying that the Russian Federation is preparing a military operation against the Republic of Moldova. Ghimpu reported that military units of Transnistria received arms from Russian depots in the sausage and near Tiraspol deployed 20 tanks. Political analysts rightly regarded Asif Chaudhry, the ""soul"" and the inspiration of the Alliance for European Integration.
In 2016, the United States supports a criminal regime
It is also well known that a special role belonged to the United States in the establishment of democracy in Moldova regime led by Vlad Plahotniuc.
When the Parliament of Moldova with the help of bribery and intimidation were formed controlled by oligarch ""majority"" and the masses come to the excitement, in January 2016 a new government supported Paul Philip, Victoria Nuland, a senior State Department official.
Why, then, the United States ignored the mood of the citizens, questionable and criminal methods of forming the ""parliamentary majority"" and bet on Vlad Plahotniuc?
Recall that while the central theme of public discourse and discontent generator byloimenno stealing billions from the country's banking sector. Krolluzhe detectives presented the first interim report and worked on the tasks of the second contract. By the time of the investigation and without public Kroll concluded that the main beneficiaries of the ""theft of the century"" - that Moldovan politicians. They create the conditions for action Ilan Shor and ""fronting"" big fraud. ""Conductor"" of the entire operation was Plahotniuc. What exactly pointed arrest partner tycoon, leader of Liberal Democratic Party Filat and its transformation into a ""scapegoat.""
The most reliable and predictable puppet
Accurate information about what is Vlad Plahotniuc is the main beneficiary of the fraud, this time the United States is certainly possessed. And it's not that Kroll is a company of American - in the case of need it any information provided at the request of the services. US full control of the entire global banking system. For information about any cash transaction, the owners, their location, correspondence, telephone conversations and other American intelligence agencies may apply at any time. They are able to be disconnected from the international interbank information transmission system and making SWIFT payments and a state like Russia. A dot may be isolated from the global financial system, the National Bank of any country. And now such a sanction will be applied to Iran.
You can also recall that recently the US ambassador Derek Hogan gave the Moldovan Prosecutor's IT-equipment and software for the disclosure of financial fraud, such as, say, ""theft of the century"".
In other words, the US had a whole collection of necessary information and opportunities in order to know exactly what Vlad Plahotniuc is the main beneficiary of the ""theft of the century"". I guess whether this Moldovan oligarch? Absolutely. He was well aware that the US is aware of, and the United States know that Plahotniuc aware of existing him in Washington compromising. Do not take advantage of this situation, the US just could not. In their hands was the most faithful, reliable and predictable Moldovan puppets.
Replacing the Russian presence in the US
Since the period of government-Plahotniuc Philip has been a time of unchallenged US dominance in Moldova. All areas, including national security and defense, were handed over to them at the disposal.
Let us recall a curious incident when in the middle of February 2016 17 US generals and admirals visited Moldova. The aircraft with high-ranking military landed in Chisinau unexpectedly. Istan is known that they have come to us uninvited Moldovan officials. This, in fact, no longer required.
A little later, in May of the same year, APCs and armored cars Second Cavalry Regiment of the US Army entered in Moldova through Sculeni and moved along the roads of the country. On May 9, Victory Day, the American military technology was presented at the central square of Chisinau.
Along with the unprecedented process in the field of safety-government Plahotniuc Philip embarked on a program to limit Russia's presence in the country. This also affected the rotation of military OGRF in Transnistria, Russian journalists, experts and cultural figures. A ban on cooperation with Moscow for the Moldovan government officials expelled Russian diplomats and even the vice-premier of the Russian government. Cherry on the cake was the ban on broadcasting the Russian media.
Plahotniuc and his money is very welcome in the United States
Of course, the Moldovan policy of encirclement Plahotniuc and he became a welcome guest in the United States.
When the American military equipment committed march on Moldovan roads, Plahotniuc met in Washington with the leadership of the IMF and negotiated the granting of new loans and country assistance. Already next year the oligarch twice in the United States. In New York Plakhotnyuk outlined a program of action on the Transnistrian issue: the withdrawal of Russian troops and the establishment of joint ventures with Ukraine posts around the perimeter of the unrecognized republic's borders. In December of the same year with congressmen have already discussed ""hybrid warfare against Moscow Moldova, eeagressivnaya propaganda, economic pressures, and support pro-Russian forces in the country."" Vlad Plahotniuc was accompanied on the trip those who are today a parliamentary commission called the organizers ""theft of the century"" - Iurie Leanca and Andrian Candu.
These same people received warmly at the Atlantic Council.
Was fruitful and in 2018, when a former congressional leader DPM discussed energy independence of Moldova (from Russia). In the US media out periodically and articles Plahotniuc, where he described the challenges faced by the republican hybrid war. Of course, public relations activities and cordial meeting with US Congressmen organized lobbying firms whose services are generously paid Moldovan democracy. As it turns out today, the cash poured into the right then the PDM through criminal schemes in the economy and money laundering operations.
Legal ABC
And now a new Moldovan authorities in the face of Maya Sandu in September, arrived in Washington and ""demanded"" oligarch head on a platter. On arrival home, the Prime stressed that the topic of stolen billion was one of the most important meetings with a number of US officials. The FBI has requested assistance in returning the stolen money from the country. In particular, it can be frozen the assets of those involved in the conclusion billion. Need help in the capture of Vlad Plahotniuc. Sandhu said that the government ""there are suspicions that it is in the United States.""
Answer US officials met by Maia Sandu, he proved predictable. For some actions need an official request. Conclusions private, even the US, Kroll agency may not be a subject of discussion. It - Legal ABC. It should be the case and a formal request to the authorized state bodies, ie the General Prosecutor's Office. Not having all this, Maia Sandu and accompanied her former prosecutor and current Interior Minister Andrei Nastase empty-handed back to Chisinau. Possible to re-read the Declaration of deoligarhizatsii Moldova.
In the United States do not know how long will get along MDBGS and ACUM. And Plahotniuc with his ""instruments"" and ""apparatus"" can probably be re-claimed.
Moldovans who commits to pay the stolen billions?
Long, unpleasant and nothing promising discussions the current head of the Moldovan government will have to with the IMF. This became clear again as in Washington, where the topic was also discussed.
When Maia Sandu signed the agreement on unblocking the financial assistance, it confirmed the decision of the previous government that will return the stolen billions of people. ""All that we can do in this area, it is necessary to agree with Western partners, the IMF and here is the relevant institution,"" - said Maia Sandu. According to her, negotiations may take several months, and what will be the final decision is still unknown. IMF - a global structure, but it controls the US, they have a majority voting stake. Therefore, Moldovans pay for thieves stolen billions or not will be decided by Washington.
Citizens may ask: what about the campaign promises to abolish the law of a billion? How can international and domestic consensus? Where, in the end, right? Plakhotnyuk enjoying life at Miami (in Switzerland, France, UK), and the people should return billions? For such cases (of bank failures and frauds) the IMF has two recommendations. Either the debt is repaid the state (ie, the people), or a hole in the banks covered by the Investor (ie, the people again). You prefer that? To the stolen money returned Plahotniuc? But is Maya Sandu popular in Washington explain: When you have irrefutable evidence, please send a request with the case, and we will consider it?
whether Washington will present the Moldovans on a platter the head of Plahotniuc?
In fact, the government of Maya Sandu very little chance to return the billions. Contacting Kroll, as many have long understood, it was pulling time.

But maybe, Plahotniuc will plant? Did the US government knew nothing about the role of oligarchs in the ""theft of the century""? Maybe they did not realize that 30 to 70 billion dollars from Russia to Moldova washed just because someone very powerful has created for this condition? And who is he?
Why was the US Ambassador came to Plahotniuc? Why escaped oligarch is in this country? Informed sources told the media that came to Moldova Special Forces Group, to provide an escape Plahotniuc. Where did they come from? From Romania? Ukraine? But who controls the country? The old version of the flight of the leader of the Democratic Party through Transnistria denied by local authorities. Why do I get new ones? Could it be that someone wants to hide its role in the ugly history of salvation oligarch?

Many of the climate activists point to the destructive impacts of global capitalism on their lives. 
“Capitalism = death (or extinction)”. “Cancel Capitalism.”
People’s lives are destroyed. Politicians are coopted by the corporate giants including Big Oil. The economic, environmental and social structures are undermined. The outcome is a process of Worldwide impoverishment.

Prof Michel Chossudovsky: Global Warming and the Ozone Layer: What’s More Dangerous, CO2 or Nuclear War?“Exxon: Make Them Pay”?
The unspoken truth is that Big Oil funds the campaign against Big Oil. Sounds contradictory?
Climate activists have been lied to.
The Climate Movement (New Green Deal) is funded by major charities and corporate foundations including the National Endowment for Democracy, Soros Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Brothers Trust, Shell Foundation, BP, Goldman Sachs, among others.
Whereas “Big Oil” is held responsible for the devastating impacts of the fossil fuel industry, the architects of Big Oil, namely the Rockefeller family is the major protagonist of the Green New Deal: Beginning in the 1980s, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund became leading advocates of the global warming agenda. … In their Sustainable Development Program Review, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund boasts of being one of the first major global warming activists, citing its strong advocacy for both the 1988 formation of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the 1992 establishment of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.” (The Energy & Environmental Legal Institute published in 2016).
Debate on the world’s climate is of crucial importance.
But who controls that debate? Major capitalist foundations ultimately call the shots?
There is an obvious contradictory relationship. The protest movement is funded by corporate foundations.
According to William Engdahl, the New Green Deal is an “economic project”: Prince Charles, … along with the Bank of England and City of London finance have promoted “green financial instruments,” led by Green Bonds, to redirect pension plans and mutual funds towards green projects. A key player in the linking of world financial institutions with the Green Agenda is outgoing Bank of England head Mark Carney. In December 2015, the Bank for International Settlements’ Financial Stability Board (FSB), chaired then by Carney, created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), to advise “investors, lenders and insurance about climate related risks.” That was certainly a bizarre focus for world central bankers.
And the Protest movement including the Extinction Rebellion provide a justification for investing in Green Bonds:
The omnipresent Wall Street bank, Goldman Sachs, … has just unveiled the first global index of top-ranking environmental stocks, done along with the London-based CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. The CDP, notably, is financed by investors such as HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, American International Group, and State Street Corp.
The new index, called CDP Environment EW and CDP Eurozone EW, aims to lure investment funds, state pension systems such as the CalPERS (the California Public Employees’ Retirement System) and CalSTRS (the California State Teachers’ Retirement System) with a combined $600+ billion in assets, to invest in their carefully chosen targets.
A cursory review suggests that the key climate organizations are invariably funded by corporate capital (including the Oil giants):

 The Climate Institute at climate.org, is a major research entity funded by Ford Motor Company Fund, GE Foundation, Goldman Sachs, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Shell Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, among others.
The Climate Leadership Council  is an initiative of major corporations which funds the global climate consensus.
Global Warming. The Concepts
While climate activists express their concern regarding the nefarious impacts of global capitalism on climate, including those pertaining to militarization (and defense spending), the scientific analysis of climate under the auspices of the IPCC  largely focusses on a single variable: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), i.e. the impact of increased emissions of CO2 derived from fossil fuels (including fracking) on average global temperature.
Depletion of the ozone layer is what triggers global warming. The ozone layer is in the Earth’s stratosphere. “Ozone is constantly being produced and destroyed naturally. This ozone layer filters out ultra-violet (UV) rays from the Sun and protects life on Earth.”
Greenhouse gas emissions affecting the ozone layer largely consist of water vapor (50%), carbon dioxide (CO2) (20%) and clouds (25%).  The remaining greenhouse gases (5%) is made up of small aerosol particles, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxides (N2O) (both a greenhouse gas as well as an “ozone destroyer” with devastating impacts on climate). (approximate figures provided by NASA for 2011).
Decrease of the ozone layer “will increase the amount of Ultra Violet radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, and worsen the impacts due to UV exposure.”
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the key UN body “for assessing the science related to climate change”.
The focusof the IPCC is to estimate the additional CO2 greenhouse gas generated by fossil fuel extraction. It is assumed that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from Planet Earth results solely from  CO2 emissions tied to  fossil fuel extraction (including fracking). Note: The CO2 emissions resulting from fossil fuel extraction constitute a very small percentage of total CO2 emissions (estimated at 20% of total greenhouse gas emissions), i.e a small percentage of the 20%.
The current IPCC climate debate focus consists of the following:
-Rising CO2 emissions (from fossile fuels) constitute the sole cause of global warming, attributable to the depletion of the ozone layer.
-To reduce the depletion of the ozone layer requires a reduction in fossil fuel extraction, which constitutes the major cause of rising CO2 emissions.
The IPCC May 2018 report entitled Global warming of 1.5°C puts forth the following methodology:
 “an understanding of the impacts of 1.5°C global warming above pre-industrial levels and related global emission pathways in the context of strengthening the response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.”
Most of the results in this IPCC study are based on model simulations of likely impacts comparing a 2.0 C increase in average global temperature to the 1.5°C global warming above pre-industrial levels.
The report highlights major environmental and social impacts which are based on simulations of rising temperature attributable to increased CO2 emissions attributable to fossil fuel extraction.
These include impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, species loss and extinctions (plants, insects and vertebrates), impacts on oceans and waterways, as well as social impacts including poverty.
The report distinguishes between terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems. It examines the impacts of global warming on ocean temperatures. It also addresses “associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels”and the impacts on marine life and biodiversity. The social impacts on (e.g. on fishing communities) are also acknowledged. On land, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, are projected to be lower at 1.5°C of global warming compared to 2°C. Similarly, “limiting global warming to 1.5°C is projected to reduce risks to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans”
Critique: Single Variable Analysis
There are many other complex factors which directly or indirectly affect climate and environmental structures including the ozone layer, which have been excluded from the IPCC model simulations.
The quantitative results of the IPCC are deterministic to say the least. According to MIT Professor Richard S Lindzen:
“Now here is the currently popular narrative concerning this system. The climate, a complex multifactor system, can be summarized in just one variable, the globally averaged temperature change, and is primarily controlled by the 1-2% perturbation in the energy budget due to a single variable – carbon dioxide – among many variables of comparable importance.
This is an extraordinary pair of claims based on reasoning that borders on magical thinking. It is, however, the narrative that has been widely accepted, even among many sceptics.” They omit variables which affect climate. With the exception of fossil fuel, they do not address the impacts of government policy on climate, nor do they address how US led wars as well as the multi-trillion dollar war economy threatens Planet Earth.
It is the art of omission:
A single highly relevant variable carbon-dioxide (CO2)  “Explains Everything”. (ceteris paribus).
With all other variables excluded, through omission, CO2 “Explains nothing”.
CO2 emissions cannot reasonably explain the complexities of climate change.
By centering solely on CO2, the Climate debate has excluded “everything else”.
The climatic and environmental crisis in different regions of the World are identified. The underlying causality is the single variable approach: helloCO2 emissions from fossil fuel extraction.
And the IPCC’s stylized results are then used to justify the Green New Deal multibillion corporate bonanza.
A whole series of important processes including biodiversity, animal life, poverty, species loss, etc have been explained by the IPCC solely referring to the impact of the the increase in CO2 emissions on global warming, nothing else.
The Impact of Radioactivity on Climate
Are increased CO2 emissions from fossil fuel the only cause of  climate change and environmental degradation?
In this article, we  focus briefly on the impacts on the Ozone Layer resulting from the explosion of nuclear bombs, an issue which has not been addressed by the New Green Deal, as well as radiation from nuclear  power plants.
Radiation from Nuclear Power Plants (Fukushima)
The dumping of highly radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean constitutes a potential trigger to a process of global radioactive contamination.
In this regard, since 2011, amply documented, marine life as well as species loss has been affected by the release of radioactive plutonium into the Pacific Ocean following the Fukushima-Daichi disaster.
Radioactive elements have not only been detected in the food chain in Japan, radioactive rain water has been recorded in California.
Nuclear Testing and Radioactive Fallout
The testing of nuclear weapons has been ongoing throughout the post WWII era. Among the more than 2000 tests, a large number of these tests are “not underground” or “underwater”, i.e the testing in the atmosphere. According to a 2000 Report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation to the General Assembly
“The main man-made contribution to the exposure of the world’s population [to radiation] has come from the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, from 1945 to 1980. Each nuclear test resulted in unrestrained release into the environment of substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in  the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface.”
The above report highlights the impacts of radiation on living cells as well on the concurrent incidence of leukaemia, cancer of the thyroid, lung and breast cancer.
What would be the impact of the explosion of nuclear weapons on the World’s climate?
The issue of nuclear winter was first addressed in a 1983 study by  R.P. Turco, O.B. Toon, T.P. Ackerman, J.B. Pollack, and Carl Sagan (referred to as TTAPS) “Global Atmospheric Consequences of Nuclear War”
The publication of the TTAPS study at the height of the Cold War unleashed a concern on the devastating impacts of nuclear war including its climatic impacts.
The extreme cold, high radiation levels, and the widespread destruction of industrial, medical, and transportation infrastructures along with food supplies and crops would trigger a massive death toll from starvation, exposure, and disease.
The TTAPS study concluded: “…the possibility of the extinction of Homo Sapiens cannot be excluded.”
It also created an awareness among US foreign policy-makers, which today is totally absent. Trump does not have the foggiest idea regarding the impacts of a nuclear war.
According to Atomic Archive.com which essentially summarizes the concepts of the TTAP study (p. 22) “When a nuclear weapon explodes in the air, the surrounding air is subjected to great heat, followed by relatively rapid cooling.”
These conditions are ideal for the production of tremendous amounts of nitric oxides. These oxides are carried into the upper atmosphere, where they reduce the concentration of protective ozone. Ozone is necessary to block harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the Earth’s surface.
Oxides of nitrogen form a catalytic cycle to reduce the protective ozone layer.
The nitric oxides produced by the weapons could reduce the ozone levels in the Northern Hemisphere by as much as 30 to 70 percent. Such a depletion might produce changes in the Earth’s climate, and would allow more ultraviolet radiation from the sun through the atmosphere to the surface of the Earth, where it could produce dangerous burns and a variety of potentially dangerous ecological effects.
It has been estimated that as much as 5,000 tons of nitric oxide is produced for each megaton of nuclear explosive power. See Atomic Archive
The 2008 Simulation of Nuclear Conflict. Impacts on Ozone Layer
In a major 2008 study by Michael Mills et al entitled Massive global ozone loss predicted following regional nuclear conflict (Academy of Sciences of the United States) a simulation was conducted  (largely based on the concepts outlined in the TTPS 1983 study) of a nuclear conflict involving 100 Hiroshima sized bombs. The simulation confirmed that the nuclear explosions “could produce long-term damage to the ozone layer, enabling higher than “extreme” levels of ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth’s surface, (see GSN, March 16, 2010).
Increased levels of UV radiation from the sun could persist for years, possibly with a drastic impact on humans and the environment, even thousands of miles from the area of the nuclear conflict. …
“A regional nuclear exchange of 100 15-kiloton weapons … would produce unprecedented low-ozone columns over populated areas in conjunction with the coldest surface temperatures experienced in the last 1,000 years, and would likely result in a global nuclear famine,” …
The research by Mills and colleagues was the first to address the possibility that a nuclear explosion could lead to increased ultraviolet radiation levels on Earth, according to a NCAR press release issued during the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference. NTI
According to Prof. Allan Robock:
In the 1980s, using simple climate models, we discovered that global nuclear arsenals, if used on cities and industrial areas, could produce a nuclear winter and lead to global famine.
Smoke from the fires would last for years in the upper atmosphere, blocking sunlight, and making it cold, dark and dry at the Earth’s surface. It would also destroy ozone, enhancing ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface.
While the immediate effects of nuclear strikes might kill hundreds of thousands, the numbers that would die from starvation in the years that followed could run into billions.
In the real sense of the word, nuclear war could potentially lead to a process of Human Extinction:
A very large nuclear war would be a calamity of indescribable proportions and absolutely unpredictable consequences, with the uncertainties tending toward the worse. . . . All-out nuclear war would mean the destruction of contemporary civilization, throw man back centuries, cause the deaths of hundreds of millions or billions of people, and, with a certain degree of probability, would cause man to be destroyed as a biological species . . . Andrei Sakharov, Foreign Affairs, Summer 1983
Those concerns have largely been excluded from the Climate Debate and the Extinction Rebellion.
The Extinction Rebellion Protest Movement has its eyes riveted on the rising emissions of Carbon Dioxide (from fossil fuel), heralded as “the most dangerous and prevalent greenhouse gas”.
All other variables are excluded. Scientific lies by omission..
Impacts of Chemicals on the Ozone layer
In recent history, Ozone layer depletion was caused by chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. The CFCs are a greenhouse gas which was previously used in air conditioning and cooling units including refrigerators.
The use of CFCs was banned under the Montreal Protocol. A June 2016 study however confirms that the Montreal Protocol failed to fully resolve the CFC ban:
“when countries began phasing out CFCs, manufacturers replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HFCs don’t deplete ozone, but they are potent greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. The challenge going forward, then, will be to develop new alternatives to HFCs — and to have the world adopt them, once again.”
Moreover, the Montreal Protocol did not eliminate methyl bromide (MeBr) which is an ozone-depleting substance .
Methyl bromide (MeBr) is used increasingly as a biocidal fumigant, primarily in agricultural soils prior to planting of crops. This usage carries potential for stratospheric ozone reduction due to Br atom catalysis, depending on how much MeBr escapes from fumigated soils to the atmosphere.
The IPCC simulations neglect the fact that HFC as well as MeBr constitute a threat to the ozone layer.
A recent UN report nonetheless confirms that despite the IPCC  alarm bell, “Earth’s protective ozone layer is finally healing from damage caused by aerosol sprays and coolants, a new United Nations report said.”
The ozone layer had been thinning since the late 1970s. Scientist raised the alarm and ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out worldwide.
As a result, the upper ozone layer above the Northern Hemisphere should be completely repaired in the 2030s and the gaping Antarctic ozone hole should disappear in the 2060s, according to a scientific assessment released Monday at a conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Southern Hemisphere lags a bit and its ozone layer should be healed by mid-century. (AP November 2018).
This report on ozone layer repair not only contradicts IPCC CO2 fossil fuel hype, it also suggests that the CO2 single variable analysis and projections are flawed..
Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD)
The militarization of climate is rarely mentioned in the Climate Debate. “In 1977, an international Convention was ratified by the UN General Assembly which banned ‘military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects.’”
It defined ‘environmental modification techniques’ as ‘any technique for changing –through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.’
While the substance of the 1977 Convention was reasserted in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, debate on weather modification for military use has become a scientific taboo.
Military analysts are mute on the subject. Meteorologists are not investigating the matter and environmentalists are focused on greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Neither is the possibility of climatic or environmental manipulations as part of a military and intelligence agenda, while tacitly acknowledged, part of the broader debate on climate change under UN auspices. (Michel Chossudovsky, The Ecologist, 2007)
The US possesses a vast arsenal of  electromagnetic weapons which are capable of  disrupting  climate through environmental modification techniques (ENMOD). (See the author’s earlier writings)
The impacts of ENMOD techniques for military use were documented by CBC TV in the early 1990s. The  report acknowledged that the HAARP facility in Alaska (now closed down or transferred to another location) under the auspices of the US Air Force had the ability of triggering typhoons, earthquakes, floods and droughts:
Directed energy is such a powerful technology it could be used to heat the ionosphere to turn weather into a weapon of war. Imagine using a flood to destroy a city or tornadoes to decimate an approaching army in the desert. The military has spent a huge amount of time on weather modification as a concept for battle environments. If an electromagnetic pulse went off over a city, basically all the electronic things in your home would wink and go out, and they would be permanently destroyed.”
“Owning the Weather” for Military Use
According to US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report, the US Military Would eventually “Own the Weather”.
Advanced techniques of climatic warfare including environmental modification techniques:
“offer(s) the war fighter a wide range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary”, capabilities, it says, extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes:
Weather modification will become a part of domestic and international security and could be done unilaterally… It could have offensive and defensive applications and even be used for deterrence purposes. The ability to generate precipitation, fog and storms on earth or to modify space weather… and the production of artificial weather all are a part of an integrated set of [military] technologies.”  (emphasis added)
Concluding Remarks 
Climate instability is an important concern. But it cannot be analyzed in isolation. It is an extremely complex process.
While there is a significant grassroots movement of young activists, the CO2 Climate Consensus has distracted millions of people from an understanding of the broader and ongoing threats to human life on Planet Earth. 
These climate strikes are taking place at a time of crisis, largely marked by US threats to wage war on Iran. The use of tactical nuclear weapons against Iran is contemplated.
Activists are often misled by those who fund the campaign including Rockefeller et al, as well as by the organizers and the public relations operatives involving Hollywood celebrities, et al.
In a bitter irony, the movement against capitalism is funded by capitalism. It’s called “manufactured dissent”. Global warfare
Global warfare using advanced weapons systems coupled with deliberate acts of destruction, sabotage and destabilization of sovereign countries constitutes the most serious threat to the survival of humanity.
The globalization of war is coupled with the derogation of civil rights, the surveillance State, neoliberal IMF-World Bank macroeconomic reforms applied Worldwide which trigger mass poverty, unemployment and environmental destruction. This global policy framework (controlled by powerful financial interests) repeals workers’ rights, destroys family farming, undermines the Welfare state leading to the privatization health and education, etc.
What is required is a broad protest movement which encompasses these interrelated dimensions. The underlying causes of this Worldwide Crisis must be understood. It is not caused by a single variable (aka CO2 emissions).
The Extinction Debate and Nuclear War
Nine countries including US, Russia, France, China, UK, Israel, Pakistan, India, North Korea together possess nearly 14,000 nuclear weapons. (2017 data) The US and Russia have 6185 and 6500 respectively.
According to ICAN, “The United States and Russia maintain roughly 1,800 of their nuclear weapons on high-alert status – ready to be launched within minutes of a warning.”
Today’s nuclear bombs (with the exception of the so-called mini-nukes) are significantly more powerful in terms of explosive capacity than a Hiroshima bomb.
The B61.11 “mini-nuke” (categorized as a “low yield” “more usable” nuclear bomb) has an explosive capacity between one third and twelve times a Hiroshima bomb.
People should understand. There are enough nuclear bombs to destroy life on planet Earth several times over. Surely this should be part of the Extinction Debate.
While one can conceptualize the loss of life and destruction resulting from previous wars including Iraq and Afghanistan, it is impossible to fully comprehend the devastation which might result from a Third World War, using “new technologies” and advanced weapons, until it occurs and becomes a reality. The international community has endorsed nuclear war in the name of world peace. “Making the world safer” is the justification for launching a military operation which could potentially result in a nuclear holocaust.  (Michel Chossudovsky, 2011)
War rather than CO2 emissions is the greatest threat to humanity. Oops, according to the media, nuclear weapons are a means to achieving World peace.
Trump has a 1.2 trillion dollar nuclear weapons program, initially set up by Obama.
While this multibillion dollar project is intended “to make the world safer”, these (expensive) nuclear weapons are categorized as “more usable” “humanitarian bombs”, “safe for the surrounding population”, according to scientific opinion on contract to the Pentagon.
US-NATO and their allies are involved in illegal acts of war. Nuclear war is on the drawing-board of the Pentagon.
But these wars are no longer illegal: they are part of the “responsibility to protect” (R2P). These are “humanitarian wars” or “counter-terrorism” ops despite the fact that millions of people have been killed and entire nations have been destroyed. It’s called “collateral damage”.
Needless to say, there are powerful financial interests behind the globalization of war.
War is good for business. And luckily for the Military Industrial Complex, the antiwar movement is dead.
The Ritual of Rebellion Prevails. 
University of Manchester sociologist Max Gluckman (1911-1975) in his writings showed how ritualized forms of rebellion by those who protest against those in power “through a controlled expression of hostility to authority” ultimately leads to the reinforcement of the established structures of authority.
Is that not what is happening today? The movement against capitalism is funded and supported by capitalism.
The antiwar movement is dead. There are no protests directed against global warfare and the use of nuclear weapons on a first strike basis.",FAKE

 The Climate Institute at climate.org, is a major research entity funded by Ford Motor Company Fund, GE Foundation, Goldman Sachs, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Shell Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, among others.
The Climate Leadership Council  is an initiative of major corporations which funds the global climate consensus.
Global Warming. The Concepts
While climate activists express their concern regarding the nefarious impacts of global capitalism on climate, including those pertaining to militarization (and defense spending), the scientific analysis of climate under the auspices of the IPCC  largely focusses on a single variable: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), i.e. the impact of increased emissions of CO2 derived from fossil fuels (including fracking) on average global temperature.
Depletion of the ozone layer is what triggers global warming. The ozone layer is in the Earth’s stratosphere. “Ozone is constantly being produced and destroyed naturally. This ozone layer filters out ultra-violet (UV) rays from the Sun and protects life on Earth.”
Greenhouse gas emissions affecting the ozone layer largely consist of water vapor (50%), carbon dioxide (CO2) (20%) and clouds (25%).  The remaining greenhouse gases (5%) is made up of small aerosol particles, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxides (N2O) (both a greenhouse gas as well as an “ozone destroyer” with devastating impacts on climate). (approximate figures provided by NASA for 2011).
Decrease of the ozone layer “will increase the amount of Ultra Violet radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, and worsen the impacts due to UV exposure.”
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the key UN body “for assessing the science related to climate change”.
The focusof the IPCC is to estimate the additional CO2 greenhouse gas generated by fossil fuel extraction. It is assumed that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from Planet Earth results solely from  CO2 emissions tied to  fossil fuel extraction (including fracking). Note: The CO2 emissions resulting from fossil fuel extraction constitute a very small percentage of total CO2 emissions (estimated at 20% of total greenhouse gas emissions), i.e a small percentage of the 20%.
The current IPCC climate debate focus consists of the following:
-Rising CO2 emissions (from fossile fuels) constitute the sole cause of global warming, attributable to the depletion of the ozone layer.
-To reduce the depletion of the ozone layer requires a reduction in fossil fuel extraction, which constitutes the major cause of rising CO2 emissions.
The IPCC May 2018 report entitled Global warming of 1.5°C puts forth the following methodology:
 “an understanding of the impacts of 1.5°C global warming above pre-industrial levels and related global emission pathways in the context of strengthening the response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.”
Most of the results in this IPCC study are based on model simulations of likely impacts comparing a 2.0 C increase in average global temperature to the 1.5°C global warming above pre-industrial levels.
The report highlights major environmental and social impacts which are based on simulations of rising temperature attributable to increased CO2 emissions attributable to fossil fuel extraction.
These include impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, species loss and extinctions (plants, insects and vertebrates), impacts on oceans and waterways, as well as social impacts including poverty.
The report distinguishes between terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems. It examines the impacts of global warming on ocean temperatures. It also addresses “associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels”and the impacts on marine life and biodiversity. The social impacts on (e.g. on fishing communities) are also acknowledged. On land, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, are projected to be lower at 1.5°C of global warming compared to 2°C. Similarly, “limiting global warming to 1.5°C is projected to reduce risks to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans”
Critique: Single Variable Analysis
There are many other complex factors which directly or indirectly affect climate and environmental structures including the ozone layer, which have been excluded from the IPCC model simulations.
The quantitative results of the IPCC are deterministic to say the least. According to MIT Professor Richard S Lindzen:
“Now here is the currently popular narrative concerning this system. The climate, a complex multifactor system, can be summarized in just one variable, the globally averaged temperature change, and is primarily controlled by the 1-2% perturbation in the energy budget due to a single variable – carbon dioxide – among many variables of comparable importance.
This is an extraordinary pair of claims based on reasoning that borders on magical thinking. It is, however, the narrative that has been widely accepted, even among many sceptics.” They omit variables which affect climate. With the exception of fossil fuel, they do not address the impacts of government policy on climate, nor do they address how US led wars as well as the multi-trillion dollar war economy threatens Planet Earth.
It is the art of omission:
A single highly relevant variable carbon-dioxide (CO2)  “Explains Everything”. (ceteris paribus).
With all other variables excluded, through omission, CO2 “Explains nothing”.
CO2 emissions cannot reasonably explain the complexities of climate change.
By centering solely on CO2, the Climate debate has excluded “everything else”.
The climatic and environmental crisis in different regions of the World are identified. The underlying causality is the single variable approach: helloCO2 emissions from fossil fuel extraction.
And the IPCC’s stylized results are then used to justify the Green New Deal multibillion corporate bonanza.
A whole series of important processes including biodiversity, animal life, poverty, species loss, etc have been explained by the IPCC solely referring to the impact of the the increase in CO2 emissions on global warming, nothing else.
The Impact of Radioactivity on Climate
Are increased CO2 emissions from fossil fuel the only cause of  climate change and environmental degradation?
In this article, we  focus briefly on the impacts on the Ozone Layer resulting from the explosion of nuclear bombs, an issue which has not been addressed by the New Green Deal, as well as radiation from nuclear  power plants.
Radiation from Nuclear Power Plants (Fukushima)
The dumping of highly radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean constitutes a potential trigger to a process of global radioactive contamination.
In this regard, since 2011, amply documented, marine life as well as species loss has been affected by the release of radioactive plutonium into the Pacific Ocean following the Fukushima-Daichi disaster.
Radioactive elements have not only been detected in the food chain in Japan, radioactive rain water has been recorded in California.
Nuclear Testing and Radioactive Fallout
The testing of nuclear weapons has been ongoing throughout the post WWII era. Among the more than 2000 tests, a large number of these tests are “not underground” or “underwater”, i.e the testing in the atmosphere. According to a 2000 Report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation to the General Assembly
“The main man-made contribution to the exposure of the world’s population [to radiation] has come from the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, from 1945 to 1980. Each nuclear test resulted in unrestrained release into the environment of substantial quantities of radioactive materials, which were widely dispersed in  the atmosphere and deposited everywhere on the Earth’s surface.”
The above report highlights the impacts of radiation on living cells as well on the concurrent incidence of leukaemia, cancer of the thyroid, lung and breast cancer.
What would be the impact of the explosion of nuclear weapons on the World’s climate?
The issue of nuclear winter was first addressed in a 1983 study by  R.P. Turco, O.B. Toon, T.P. Ackerman, J.B. Pollack, and Carl Sagan (referred to as TTAPS) “Global Atmospheric Consequences of Nuclear War”
The publication of the TTAPS study at the height of the Cold War unleashed a concern on the devastating impacts of nuclear war including its climatic impacts.
The extreme cold, high radiation levels, and the widespread destruction of industrial, medical, and transportation infrastructures along with food supplies and crops would trigger a massive death toll from starvation, exposure, and disease.
The TTAPS study concluded: “…the possibility of the extinction of Homo Sapiens cannot be excluded.”
It also created an awareness among US foreign policy-makers, which today is totally absent. Trump does not have the foggiest idea regarding the impacts of a nuclear war.
According to Atomic Archive.com which essentially summarizes the concepts of the TTAP study (p. 22) “When a nuclear weapon explodes in the air, the surrounding air is subjected to great heat, followed by relatively rapid cooling.”
These conditions are ideal for the production of tremendous amounts of nitric oxides. These oxides are carried into the upper atmosphere, where they reduce the concentration of protective ozone. Ozone is necessary to block harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the Earth’s surface.
Oxides of nitrogen form a catalytic cycle to reduce the protective ozone layer.
The nitric oxides produced by the weapons could reduce the ozone levels in the Northern Hemisphere by as much as 30 to 70 percent. Such a depletion might produce changes in the Earth’s climate, and would allow more ultraviolet radiation from the sun through the atmosphere to the surface of the Earth, where it could produce dangerous burns and a variety of potentially dangerous ecological effects.
It has been estimated that as much as 5,000 tons of nitric oxide is produced for each megaton of nuclear explosive power. See Atomic Archive
The 2008 Simulation of Nuclear Conflict. Impacts on Ozone Layer
In a major 2008 study by Michael Mills et al entitled Massive global ozone loss predicted following regional nuclear conflict (Academy of Sciences of the United States) a simulation was conducted  (largely based on the concepts outlined in the TTPS 1983 study) of a nuclear conflict involving 100 Hiroshima sized bombs. The simulation confirmed that the nuclear explosions “could produce long-term damage to the ozone layer, enabling higher than “extreme” levels of ultraviolet radiation to reach the Earth’s surface, (see GSN, March 16, 2010).
Increased levels of UV radiation from the sun could persist for years, possibly with a drastic impact on humans and the environment, even thousands of miles from the area of the nuclear conflict. …
“A regional nuclear exchange of 100 15-kiloton weapons … would produce unprecedented low-ozone columns over populated areas in conjunction with the coldest surface temperatures experienced in the last 1,000 years, and would likely result in a global nuclear famine,” …
The research by Mills and colleagues was the first to address the possibility that a nuclear explosion could lead to increased ultraviolet radiation levels on Earth, according to a NCAR press release issued during the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference. NTI
According to Prof. Allan Robock:
In the 1980s, using simple climate models, we discovered that global nuclear arsenals, if used on cities and industrial areas, could produce a nuclear winter and lead to global famine.
Smoke from the fires would last for years in the upper atmosphere, blocking sunlight, and making it cold, dark and dry at the Earth’s surface. It would also destroy ozone, enhancing ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface.
While the immediate effects of nuclear strikes might kill hundreds of thousands, the numbers that would die from starvation in the years that followed could run into billions.
In the real sense of the word, nuclear war could potentially lead to a process of Human Extinction:
A very large nuclear war would be a calamity of indescribable proportions and absolutely unpredictable consequences, with the uncertainties tending toward the worse. . . . All-out nuclear war would mean the destruction of contemporary civilization, throw man back centuries, cause the deaths of hundreds of millions or billions of people, and, with a certain degree of probability, would cause man to be destroyed as a biological species . . . Andrei Sakharov, Foreign Affairs, Summer 1983
Those concerns have largely been excluded from the Climate Debate and the Extinction Rebellion.
The Extinction Rebellion Protest Movement has its eyes riveted on the rising emissions of Carbon Dioxide (from fossil fuel), heralded as “the most dangerous and prevalent greenhouse gas”.
All other variables are excluded. Scientific lies by omission..
Impacts of Chemicals on the Ozone layer
In recent history, Ozone layer depletion was caused by chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs. The CFCs are a greenhouse gas which was previously used in air conditioning and cooling units including refrigerators.
The use of CFCs was banned under the Montreal Protocol. A June 2016 study however confirms that the Montreal Protocol failed to fully resolve the CFC ban:
“when countries began phasing out CFCs, manufacturers replaced them with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). HFCs don’t deplete ozone, but they are potent greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. The challenge going forward, then, will be to develop new alternatives to HFCs — and to have the world adopt them, once again.”
Moreover, the Montreal Protocol did not eliminate methyl bromide (MeBr) which is an ozone-depleting substance .
Methyl bromide (MeBr) is used increasingly as a biocidal fumigant, primarily in agricultural soils prior to planting of crops. This usage carries potential for stratospheric ozone reduction due to Br atom catalysis, depending on how much MeBr escapes from fumigated soils to the atmosphere.
The IPCC simulations neglect the fact that HFC as well as MeBr constitute a threat to the ozone layer.
A recent UN report nonetheless confirms that despite the IPCC  alarm bell, “Earth’s protective ozone layer is finally healing from damage caused by aerosol sprays and coolants, a new United Nations report said.”
The ozone layer had been thinning since the late 1970s. Scientist raised the alarm and ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out worldwide.
As a result, the upper ozone layer above the Northern Hemisphere should be completely repaired in the 2030s and the gaping Antarctic ozone hole should disappear in the 2060s, according to a scientific assessment released Monday at a conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Southern Hemisphere lags a bit and its ozone layer should be healed by mid-century. (AP November 2018).
This report on ozone layer repair not only contradicts IPCC CO2 fossil fuel hype, it also suggests that the CO2 single variable analysis and projections are flawed..
Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD)
The militarization of climate is rarely mentioned in the Climate Debate. “In 1977, an international Convention was ratified by the UN General Assembly which banned ‘military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects.’”
It defined ‘environmental modification techniques’ as ‘any technique for changing –through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.’
While the substance of the 1977 Convention was reasserted in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, debate on weather modification for military use has become a scientific taboo.
Military analysts are mute on the subject. Meteorologists are not investigating the matter and environmentalists are focused on greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Neither is the possibility of climatic or environmental manipulations as part of a military and intelligence agenda, while tacitly acknowledged, part of the broader debate on climate change under UN auspices. (Michel Chossudovsky, The Ecologist, 2007)
The US possesses a vast arsenal of  electromagnetic weapons which are capable of  disrupting  climate through environmental modification techniques (ENMOD). (See the author’s earlier writings)
The impacts of ENMOD techniques for military use were documented by CBC TV in the early 1990s. The  report acknowledged that the HAARP facility in Alaska (now closed down or transferred to another location) under the auspices of the US Air Force had the ability of triggering typhoons, earthquakes, floods and droughts:
Directed energy is such a powerful technology it could be used to heat the ionosphere to turn weather into a weapon of war. Imagine using a flood to destroy a city or tornadoes to decimate an approaching army in the desert. The military has spent a huge amount of time on weather modification as a concept for battle environments. If an electromagnetic pulse went off over a city, basically all the electronic things in your home would wink and go out, and they would be permanently destroyed.”
“Owning the Weather” for Military Use
According to US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report, the US Military Would eventually “Own the Weather”.
Advanced techniques of climatic warfare including environmental modification techniques:
“offer(s) the war fighter a wide range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary”, capabilities, it says, extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes:
Weather modification will become a part of domestic and international security and could be done unilaterally… It could have offensive and defensive applications and even be used for deterrence purposes. The ability to generate precipitation, fog and storms on earth or to modify space weather… and the production of artificial weather all are a part of an integrated set of [military] technologies.”  (emphasis added)
Concluding Remarks 
Climate instability is an important concern. But it cannot be analyzed in isolation. It is an extremely complex process.
While there is a significant grassroots movement of young activists, the CO2 Climate Consensus has distracted millions of people from an understanding of the broader and ongoing threats to human life on Planet Earth. 
These climate strikes are taking place at a time of crisis, largely marked by US threats to wage war on Iran. The use of tactical nuclear weapons against Iran is contemplated.
Activists are often misled by those who fund the campaign including Rockefeller et al, as well as by the organizers and the public relations operatives involving Hollywood celebrities, et al.
In a bitter irony, the movement against capitalism is funded by capitalism. It’s called “manufactured dissent”. Global warfare
Global warfare using advanced weapons systems coupled with deliberate acts of destruction, sabotage and destabilization of sovereign countries constitutes the most serious threat to the survival of humanity.
The globalization of war is coupled with the derogation of civil rights, the surveillance State, neoliberal IMF-World Bank macroeconomic reforms applied Worldwide which trigger mass poverty, unemployment and environmental destruction. This global policy framework (controlled by powerful financial interests) repeals workers’ rights, destroys family farming, undermines the Welfare state leading to the privatization health and education, etc.
What is required is a broad protest movement which encompasses these interrelated dimensions. The underlying causes of this Worldwide Crisis must be understood. It is not caused by a single variable (aka CO2 emissions).
The Extinction Debate and Nuclear War
Nine countries including US, Russia, France, China, UK, Israel, Pakistan, India, North Korea together possess nearly 14,000 nuclear weapons. (2017 data) The US and Russia have 6185 and 6500 respectively.
According to ICAN, “The United States and Russia maintain roughly 1,800 of their nuclear weapons on high-alert status – ready to be launched within minutes of a warning.”
Today’s nuclear bombs (with the exception of the so-called mini-nukes) are significantly more powerful in terms of explosive capacity than a Hiroshima bomb.
The B61.11 “mini-nuke” (categorized as a “low yield” “more usable” nuclear bomb) has an explosive capacity between one third and twelve times a Hiroshima bomb.
People should understand. There are enough nuclear bombs to destroy life on planet Earth several times over. Surely this should be part of the Extinction Debate.
While one can conceptualize the loss of life and destruction resulting from previous wars including Iraq and Afghanistan, it is impossible to fully comprehend the devastation which might result from a Third World War, using “new technologies” and advanced weapons, until it occurs and becomes a reality. The international community has endorsed nuclear war in the name of world peace. “Making the world safer” is the justification for launching a military operation which could potentially result in a nuclear holocaust.  (Michel Chossudovsky, 2011)
War rather than CO2 emissions is the greatest threat to humanity. Oops, according to the media, nuclear weapons are a means to achieving World peace.
Trump has a 1.2 trillion dollar nuclear weapons program, initially set up by Obama.
While this multibillion dollar project is intended “to make the world safer”, these (expensive) nuclear weapons are categorized as “more usable” “humanitarian bombs”, “safe for the surrounding population”, according to scientific opinion on contract to the Pentagon.
US-NATO and their allies are involved in illegal acts of war. Nuclear war is on the drawing-board of the Pentagon.
But these wars are no longer illegal: they are part of the “responsibility to protect” (R2P). These are “humanitarian wars” or “counter-terrorism” ops despite the fact that millions of people have been killed and entire nations have been destroyed. It’s called “collateral damage”.
Needless to say, there are powerful financial interests behind the globalization of war.
War is good for business. And luckily for the Military Industrial Complex, the antiwar movement is dead.
The Ritual of Rebellion Prevails. 
University of Manchester sociologist Max Gluckman (1911-1975) in his writings showed how ritualized forms of rebellion by those who protest against those in power “through a controlled expression of hostility to authority” ultimately leads to the reinforcement of the established structures of authority.
Is that not what is happening today? The movement against capitalism is funded and supported by capitalism.
The antiwar movement is dead. There are no protests directed against global warfare and the use of nuclear weapons on a first strike basis.",FAKE
1023,Greta Thunberg invented malicious adults. Invented as a tool,"Children - is ""excellent pawns""
Something unprecedented is happening for a long time in Italy. On Friday, September 27, hundreds of thousands of students and students left classes and crowds took to the streets with slogans and banners - to protect the planet's climate ...
Milan city center is filled by about 300 thousand people. In the central Piazza Duomo crowd of young people under the cheering and hooting burned a huge scale model of the world, chanting in chorus: ""save the planet"", ""Our house is on fire!"", ""Act fast!"". In Turin, the demonstrators joined the mayor of Mizerokki Stefano, who stated about the threat of exit from the Mont Blanc massive glacier ... Similar events were held simultaneously in 180 (!) Italian cities, about 1 million people took part in them. Judging by the commercials, laid out in the Italian media, young people swept like crazy, they cried and shouted as if a catastrophe on the planet should break out tomorrow. Violent demonstrations, which coined a special slogan Fridays for Future, held in many cities outside of Italy. Teens, boys, girls call every Friday to go on strike, do not go to school and to demand from the authorities the urgent measures to prevent the ""destruction of the planet.""
The starting point was the orgy of speech at the UN General Assembly 16-year-old girl Greta Thunberg from Sweden - autistic, disabled from childhood, which we wrote about.
Greta led international movement encourages students to skip class and protest against the human impact on the environment. ""Amnesty International"" Greta awarded the title of ""Ambassador of Conscience"". MPs from Swedish Riksdag Left party MPs Norwegian storting Socialist left party (both structures are combined ecosocialists, Marxists, Trotskyists LGBT activists and radical feminists) Greta nominated for the Nobel Prize world. American Time included it among the 100 most influential people in 2019.
Supposedly spontaneous demonstrations of adolescents and young people in the ""Climate Protection"" began, as if on cue, both in Italy and in many other countries. Somehow, no one asks: Is there more pressing problems than climate change? Who are so in sync triggers a reaction in the world?
The Italian newspaper ""Giornale» (ilgiornale.it) recalled that many scientists, recognizing the urgent need to fight for the protection of the environment, are categorically against the spell of the disaster, which says Greta. ""Giornale"" reported that recently, 500 scientists from around the world sent a letter to UN Secretary General to protest against inflation, ""the climate of anxiety."" At the root of the initiative necessary geophysicist Professor Guus Berkhout Hague University, supported by scientists and scientific organizations from 13 countries. However, ""the letter five hundred"" nobody paid attention ...
As the Italian Professor Franco Battaglia, now we come out of the Little Ice Age, and it lasted for three centuries. And the last 150 years, the climate is stable beyond all expectations: the temperature increase almost 0.8 degrees over the past 150 years. ""There are other theses? - asks the newspaper. - Very well, let us discuss, but do not panic. "" However, I received a request to panic. And panic strongly injected. Who! No answer. Most importantly, successfully found the image of protest - ""a girl with pigtails"" Greta, a fighter for the purity of nature on Earth. We choose a teenager with autism. Such ""politically incorrect"" to criticize, it is trouble-free driving means society.
As stresses chief editor of the American magazine National Review, Rich Lowry, Greta Thunberg ""created"" by a special technology cynical adults. Created as a tool. ""Children are especially adjusted to hysteria and depression,"" - says Lowry, advising readers to ignore the fiery statements Greta about climate catastrophe. Of the children reminded Rich Lowry, ""make excellent pawn"", and Swedish schoolgirl in a pawn turned.
However, neither Lowry, National Review or can not answer the question of who and for what purpose this pawn moves. Who is behind the scenes of protests that erupted after the performance of Greta as a fire?
Recall the ""student revolution"" in 1968 in France, when he was forced to resign, President Charles de Gaulle (it was he who was the target). Years later, it became known that the leaders of the Paris ""May Day"" manipulated by the CIA ... The whole world saw the photo of girl with the Kiev Maidan, which is exposed on camera poster: ""I am a girl. I want to lace panties and want the EU ""... In all the"" color revolutions ""2000-2014 years - in Serbia and Georgia, the Middle East and Ukraine - the young were used as dynamite that blew up the political regime. And the regime fell - in one country after another.
What money Swedish girl with pigtails makes a trip around the world? Who writes her texts that she reads from the stands? Who pays for it staying in the hotels, for her photo shoot with Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Pope, for its transoceanic tour on a yacht Rothschild worth 4 million euros? Who finances unprecedented latitude Greta advertising in the media? International play with Greta superstar beyond all imaginable scale similar representations ...
Greek online newspaper ""Russian Athens"" writes: ""The fact that"" Greta Thunberg ""- project, no doubt. Original zakoporschikami made Scandinavian globalists of the left wing. To some pores project supervised by Swedish PR expert and businessman Ingmar Renttshog (who did not fail by using her name, to attract millions of dollars on its environmental start-We Do not Have Time) and the owner of the Stockholm public relations office Iles PR Helena Iles (by the way, an old friend of the girl's mother). From the winter of 2018/2019 Project promotion do superseroznye supranational structures like the Club of Rome (14 March he issued a special statement in support of Greta). Direct supervision of exercise of the Soros Foundation and the organization of the ""Global Marshall Plan"" (headed by former United States Al Gore, Vice-President, looms the same George Soros among key figures), experienced representatives who formed at Thunberg ""coaching staff"", inspire and point in the right direction, sculpt long texts, provide protection, cut off unwanted people. Many photos and video next to Greta, you can see the young German political scientist Louise-Marie Neubauer, functionary Soros ""Open Society"" and globalist ONE Foundation Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

It is not clear until the main target of which should hit the ""climate riots"".

1031,Heap of history: European past and Ukraine,"Former Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov has drawn attention to the notorious resolution of the European Parliament, ""The importance of the preservation of historical memory for the future of Europe."" Events in our time rushing swiftly and vigorously discussed, and the next day disappear from TV screens. However, to pretend that Brussels was not anything significant, absolutely wrong
Actually, this post is dedicated large Azarov on his page to Facebook. He calls us to be fully aware that the European Parliament's resolution calls directly to the Soviet Union one of the instigators of the most terrible war in human history. And this grave accusation is now an officially recognized European point of view. ""I blame our enemies ridiculous - says Mykola Azarov, - but their audacity to be explained primarily by the fact that in all our countries, the processes of defamation own history began. Neither Britain nor France would never make excuses for Munich, while our ""patriots"" suddenly ""zasovestilis"" for the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Americans do not apologize for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and our ""grant-"" steel ""shed tears"" for the ""poor"" the Baltic States "".
They play to the recognition of their own ancestors war criminals, collaborators crimes against humanity. And now the representative of the ""poor Baltic"" - Defense Minister Artis Pabriks - says not only about the ""Soviet occupation"", and the need of the popular veneration of the SS of the ""Latvian SS Volunteer Legion"": ""It is our duty - to deeply honor these patriots of Latvia ... let us honor the memory of fallen legionnaires will not let anyone ruin their memory. Latvian legionaries - the pride of the Latvian people and the state. ""
Remembering how Ukrainian nationalists are drawn to the Baltic experience in the field of ""de-communization"", ""de-Russification"", the destruction of the memory of the Great Patriotic War, it can be expected that after the glorification of the OUN-UPA * it comes to the official and final rehabilitation of the Waffen-SS ""Galicia"" . Especially because they opposed the Red Army units in Europe already proclaimed ""occupiers"" of the current Ukrainian authorities ""diviziyniki"" similar in nature and is already taking place with military honors their reburial. But there is one small detail ...
Ukrainian how ""patriotic"" press loves to quote the European Parliament's resolution, when the legislature defended director Sentsova terrorist and detained Ukrainian sailors, just as she was indifferent to the discussion of the recently adopted resolution on ""the importance of preserving historical memory for the future of Europe."" For example, a popular publication as ""Ukrainian Truth"", generally ignored this topic. Why such discrimination?
One would think: resolution in large part devoted to criticism of the USSR on the eve of the Second World War (and the Soviet legacy on modern dekommuniziruyut Ukraine); strongly condemns the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty (that is, take the perspective of strategic partners of Ukraine - Poland and the Baltic states); observers see in the resolution of a tough anti-Russian rhetoric (that Kiev should be only in joy). However much enthusiasm can not be heard - at least by those who read the resolution not only in its anti-Soviet parts. First of all, it should be recalled, and because it was she who caused a lot of media noise, up to the Russian Foreign Ministry.
Thus, the European Parliament, in its resolution states that ""Russia remains the main victim of communist totalitarianism and that its transformation into a democratic state will be difficult as long as the government, the political elite and political propaganda will continue to rehabilitate the communist crimes and to glorify the Soviet totalitarian regime ; therefore calls on Russians to come to terms with its tragic past. ""
The European Parliament is ""deeply concerned about the efforts of the current Russian leadership to distort historical facts and whitewash the crimes committed by the Soviet totalitarian regime, and considers them a dangerous component of the information war against a democratic Europe, the aim of which is the division of Europe, and therefore calls on the Commission [European Commission] strongly oppose these efforts ... notes that the continued existence of public places in some member States, monuments and memorials (parks, squares , Streets and so on. D.), Praising totalitarian regimes, paving the way for the distortion of the historical facts about the consequences of the Second World War and for the promotion of a totalitarian political system. ""
Of course, such one-sided and biased assessment could not remain without a response from the Russian Federation. Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova indicates a blatant distortion of facts: ""The resolution makes no mention of the policy pursued by Western countries appeasement with the aim of reorienting Hitler's expansionist plans in the West to the East, and climax of this line - the 1938 Munich Agreement. The participants gave at the mercy of the Nazis sovereign state - Czechoslovakia ... ""Who wants to read more information about this subject can refer to my article"" Pact as a fact "", dedicated to the 80th anniversary of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. It is worth noting that the draft resolution on one of the main political forces in the European Parliament - the European People's Party - was stated bluntly: ""The continued existence in public spaces (parks, squares, streets, etc...) Of some Member States Monuments and memorials glorifying Soviet army [emphasis mine - KK] occupied by the same country, creates conditions for distorting the truth about the consequences of the second World war and the promotion of a totalitarian political system. "" That is to say, very frankly stated (as implied in the resolution adopted) that the Soviet army - with all its four Ukrainian fronts - is an ""occupant"". Millions of Ukrainians (and other nationalities of the Soviet soldiers who fought and died in the war against Nazism) are recognized as invaders, and the veneration of the memory itself of these people who saved Europe from Nazism, in fact a crime.
It would seem, and this fits in infamy postmaydannuyu mythology, where the place of the holiday Victory Day should take the amorphous Memorial Day May 8 - on the historical memory of its people ruling camarilla in Kiev for a long time do not care, and in the field enough opportunists willing to betray the memory of their ancestors. However, here comes the fun part: the European Parliament resolution closely affects the new Ukrainian (and not only Ukrainian) realities.
The European Parliament ""condemns historical revisionism, and glorification of Nazi collaborators in several EU Member States"", and it is actually a direct reference to the Baltic States with their cult of SS legionnaires. The document also expresses deep concern about ""the growing popularity of radical ideologies and return to fascism, racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance,"" ""taking place in some Member States soobschnost between, on the one hand, political leaders, political parties and law enforcement agencies, and on the other - the radical, racist and xenophobic movements acting under various political labels. ""
The European Parliament called ""in the strongest terms to condemn such acts, because they undermine the values ​​of the EU - that is, peace, freedom and democracy"" to condemn and oppose all forms of Holocaust denial, ""including an understatement and trivialization of crimes committed by the Nazis and their collaborators, as well as to avoid to the political and media space observed similar banalization of crimes. "" The European Parliament condemned the fact that ""extremist and xenophobic political forces in Europe [and not only in the EU - KK] resorted to a distortion of historical facts and use the symbolism and rhetoric, which in common with forms of totalitarian propaganda, including racism, anti-Semitism and hatred towards sexual and other minorities. ""
Given the rampant right-wing forces in Ukraine, glorification units such as ""Roland"", ""Nachtigal"" SS Division ""Galicia"", the glorification of the pro-Nazi collaborators like Sheptitskogo or Sheveleva, numerous acts of vandalism on Jewish memorials, bullying minority revitalization of the various forms of Nazi symbols, Ukraine appears as though under the double eye of criticism - and as the successor of the Soviet Union, and as the successor to today's forms of neo-Nazism and xenophobia. This makes it impossible for critics and opponents of Ukrainian realities of Kiev. I'm not talking about the dubiousness of frontiers ""invaders"" as a result of the resolution condemned ""Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"" and the end of World War II (as mentioned in the preamble of the document, in connection with the territorial losses in Romania).
Therefore, rejoice in the resolution ""On the European Memory of the importance for Europe's future,"" Ukrainian media, and ""patriotic public"" does not have to. As warned Polish politicians (who were one of the main lobbyists for the adoption of the document), ""Bandera Ukraine to Europe will not fall."" And those who opposed Bandera, evromaydanovtsy themselves thrown from their pedestals and trampled.
It always happens to those who betray the memory of their own fathers for the sake of others and of cookies gingerbread. ""His"" to the new owners, they still did not, but with real native people quarreled. Think. If what is left.",FAKE
1033,Will the ECHR Determine That Russia Occupies Crimea? Ukraine’s Bungled Attempt Stands to Massively Backfire,"Ukraine has filed a problematic complaint through the European Court of Human Rights against Russia, alleging violations of the human rights of both individual citizens, and violations against the Crimean Tatar minority on the whole. But how they’ve gone about it, may require the commission to determine – whether overtly or de facto – whether Russia’s control over Crimea is illegal. This raises serious questions about the admissibility of the claims themselves, and create a procedural headache for the ECHR. Meanwhile, the backdrop is that the ECHR understands the importance of Russia’s membership in the Council of Europe and its voluntary compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
The problem for Ukraine is that the ECHR understands this is a political process. At the same time, Russia has fought to maintain membership as much as the Council of Europe has pushed for Russia to be a member in recent times, but Russia is likely to exit if the ECHR makes the kind of irresponsible ruling that Ukraine seeks. On the balance, this places Ukraine’s claims in danger of being rejected outright, de-legitimizing their claim, and perhaps even creating the de facto precedent that an international body with standing among the parties, such as is the ECHR, treated the Russian control of Crimea as a legal (or, perhaps, ‘not illegal’) phenomenon.
But Ukraine’s aggressive moves, its poor evidence coming from previously debunked and openly Atlantic Council backed vectors, in combination with the fragile international relations involved, stands to backfire massively for the beleaguered Ukraine. The way Ukraine has constructed their case, the human rights claims are unnecessarily tied to the overarching framework of an alleged illegal annexation of Crimea on the part of Russia.
US interference in the ECHR Process will not be smiled upon
That Atlanticists in Ukraine and the US/UK are pushing this case is clear. For example, Russia’s representative to the ECHR, Deputy Justice Minister Mikhail Galperin, who has been dealing with Russia’s response to Ukraine’s suit, was put into the Myrotvorets database by Ukraine after recent court hearings.
The Myrotvorets database is a US created ‘independent’ website which lists ‘enemies’ of Ukraine. Since its creation, it has come under the de facto control of Ukrainian and US intelligence agencies, but technically is operated at arm’s length from any official structure.
Does this tell us about the attempt to politicize the whole process, interfering in Ukraine? Can this be considered as US foreign pressure on the ECHR itself?
Absolutely it can, but of course Galperin’s addition to the Myrotvorets database won’t have any effect of influencing anyone in the ECHR.  No one believes that Myrotvorets informal black-list lends any credibility to Ukraine’s case.
Just as odd as the Myrotvorets stunt is that the case involves evidence produced by Bellingcat, which does not have any official standing before international bodies, and they have been previously shown to have manufactured evidence, and their evidence could be rejected on that basis. Russia would certainly claim that Bellingcat either manufactured evidence intentionally, or that their patterns of errors in the past makes this evidence too compromised to use in a legal proceeding.
Still the games being played with Myrotvorets and Bellingcat are very clear indications that this process is being initiated and reinforced by the so-called ‘deep-state’ in the US.
So it is clear that the US has its hand in this, to simplify the dynamics and without digging further into any theory about whether Zelensky and Trump, for their part, approve of this. It’s likely the court will frown on these obvious Atlanticist moves and interference.
This all begs the question: What reaction may we expect from the ECHR?
The ECHR is being asked to make a determination outside of the scope of the initially presented case and its facts. To begin with the claim that the Russian ‘occupation’ of Crimea has resulted in the violation of the Human Rights of, for example, Tatars and protected minorities, assumes that Russia has annexed Crimea, or that its present control is illegal.
So this brings to issue many strange twists, because there is such a thing as a legal occupation: even if it were established that the referendum process was flawed, and that Russia used military or intelligence power to gain control of the Crimea, this doesn’t, on the face of it, require that Russia’s control is illegal. That splits the question three or more ways, and not just two. Russia wants to avoid any finding that says – or is inferentially based on – either that Crimea is under occupation, legally or illegally.
In consulting experts on international law and sovereignty, in the precedence established in past rulings from the ECHR, we received some interesting opinions from the Center for Syncretic Studies’ legal council, Marija Katic, who follows matters of international law closely.
In her view, Ukraine presented its case such that the court was placed in the position of asking in pre-trial hearings whether the parties want it to rule on whether Russia is an illegal occupying power. Both parties agree that Russia has control over Crimea, but Ukraine also wanted the court to rule on the legality of such control. Russia does not want the court to rule on this, or create a ruling that infers that its control is either illegal or founded on the basis of military occupation.
This may have a backlash against Ukraine. It would be more reasonable for the rights of the people concerned, to file as Russian citizens. The process so far has the claimants as Ukrainians under occupation – Russia claims these are Russian citizens (and not foreign citizens under occupation). This raises serious questions of admissibility for the ECHR to move on this in a way that Ukraine might want.
This is where the nominal case presented – human rights – exceeds the expected questions the court sought to weigh on when looking at the viability of the case in the first place.
The aim of the court in general, because matters of both creating and acting upon precedent are involved, would be to generally defer to the narrowest possible application of its authority, involving themselves in the narrowest possible creation of future precedence.
From what we understand, the court may – sooner than later – respond to Ukraine that while it can be involved in pursuing the process for a ruling given that the citizens in question maintain and affirm their Ukrainian citizenship, it is not necessary to determine if Russia is illegally in control of Crimea.
The court can proceed on this without needing to rule on the legality of Russia’s control, nor does it help the Council of Europe maintain the membership of the Russian Federation – something which the Council of Europe affirmed the importance of last June in its vote then.
What were Ukraine’s real aims?
It would seem that what Ukraine really wanted was a ruling in its favor on the legality of control, which would compel Russia to quit the Council of Europe itself – a nominal Atlanticist victory, not whether human rights were actually violated. Then the nominal case of human rights would be through that lens, one which is much more geopolitical than it needs to be otherwise. If the court had to either weigh in on whether Russia’s control of Crimea was illegal, or if it made a ruling using a framework where this much is inferred, it would not bode well for Russia-EU relations which are in fact nearing a realized rapprochement.
What Ukraine is really after, besides a case which symbolically used the premise that Russia illegally occupied Crimea, is in fact a referendum on Russia’s membership in the Council of Europe.
Those individual citizens claiming persecution for their activism to see Crimea return to Ukraine would even perhaps have a better chance at getting a favorable ruling if Russia is seen as legitimately being in control of Crimea. Setting aside the issue of admissibility of the claims against Russia, if Russia’s administration is viewed either neutrally or as legitimate, then the claimaints would have to make a case that their rights were violated under Russia’s constitution and not under international law regarding the rights of people living under occupation. And then, in turn, the question of admissibility itself arises.
Questions of human rights of people under an occupation may be more able to be resolved within international bodies, under the ECHR and with reference to Geneva, whereas if the question is addressed in a way which presumes no wrong-doing regarding Russia’s control of Crimea, then we would probably presume a finding or judgment – if one is even made – based on whether Russia has treated these citizens on an equal basis, as compared to other dissidents in the Russian Federation.
So at issue, if the issue was taken up (admissibility aside), is not whether dissidents are being treated justly by Russia under the rules of occupation, but whether Russia is being just in its internal application of its own laws. And still, this is not something the court is likely to want to take up as a matter of jurisdiction itself, because the ECHR is a human rights court, and not an international law court. There are other courts and processes for that, and it’s likely the court will be compelled to see that problem.
The contradiction in Ukraine’s case
While occupied people have a right to resist, the occupying force must also reasonably see through its obligation to the basic rights to livelihood of people under occupation who are not engaged in resistance – which do not include the same level of democratic rights or equal treatment as such. However, if Russia is not an occupying power, again, then there may be a much lessened basis for admissibility in the first place.
The claims surrounding the national oppression of Crimean Tatars, meanwhile, is a difficult claim for Ukraine to make for other reasons, given that Russia’s de facto control over Crimea has not been administered as a military authority under norms of war or occupation, but rather seeing all Crimeans including Tatars as Russian citizens, where Russia’s constitutional processes consistent throughout the rest of the Russian Federation are being observed in Crimea. Here, Tatars are indeed recognized as a protected minority by the Russian Federation, and Russia would have a strong case that the rights of Tatars under Russian control are enhanced and not decreased as a consequence.
Conclusion
Altogether, because Europe is moving in a conciliatory direction with Russia, we might expect the ECHR to direct the claimaints to refile on a different basis if such a procedure exists, or we should expect that the ECHR will be forced to not directly answer the question of the legality of the Russian control of Crimea, and therefore defer to a position of the least wrong-doing on the part of Russia. That is, while not making a finding on that question, they certainly would not want to treat the claimaints as if they are under occupation, de facto making their ruling based upon the presumption of legitimate Russian control of Crimea.
But because this is a human rights court and not an international law court as such, if the court does not view Russia’s control of Crimea as either an occupation or illegal, then the case changes entirely, and might be rejected outright.
The court will likely realize that this is a back-handed referendum on Russia’s Council of Europe membership, and wouldn’t do anything to cut against the vote last summer affirming Russia’s importance in the Council – the organ that ties it to the ECHR in the first place.
Russia for its part would probably be satisfied with any ruling based on the presumption that its control was legal, and the issue of human rights being violated or not is not an indictment on Russia on the whole, but rather of the particular authorities of law enforcement in Crimea at the most local level – Russia would then happily be in the position to compensate the victims on the basis of a de facto legitimate Russian control of Crimea.",FAKE

1037,Russian Military Space Forces in Syria have become a symbol of change in the world - expert,"Russian expert Yevgeny Mikhailov gave an assessment of four years elapsed since the entry into Syria Russian VKS.
BAKU, October 1 - Sputnik, Alexander Zuev. Russian Military Space Forces in Syria are a symbol of change in the world: they proved that Russia - a great power, and the world is no longer unipolar, said Sputnik Azerbaijan security expert Eugene Mikhailov.
Operations of the Military Space Forces (VKS) of Russia in Syria September 30 was four years old.
For four years, the presence of Russian VKS much has been achieved in Syria. But, more importantly, it managed to keep Syria as a country: due to the presence of Russian VKS militants were repulsed major Syrian cities. A battle for Palmyra and did become a legend combat, Mikhailov stressed.
In addition, the Russian side the latest weapons were used in Syria, which has shown to the world that Russia is not kneeling. Now it presents itself as a world power, capable to defend its national interests, he said.
""By participating in the Syrian conflict, Russia has demonstrated its ability to confront any threats to the global scale,"" - he stressed.
At the same time, according to the interlocutor Sputnik Azerbaijan, Russia defended in Syria and its national interests. She did not allow this country to collapse under the onslaught of terrorists including because they knew: capturing Syria, the rebels moved on - in the direction of Russia. And these fears are not groundless, considering the activities of armed groups in the territory of Russia, in particular in the North Caucasus, he said.
VSK sending to Syria, Russia pre-empted many of the threats to its national interests. And sent message of the international community that Moscow is not going to idly look at how shaken the Middle East, Mikhailov said.
Four years later, the Arab world has become a different look at Russia. Previously, he underestimated her, but now wants to be friends with her, the expert believes.
The fact that the Americans and their allies worked in the Middle East - it is a tragedy. Were destroyed entire nations, all around was chaos, convenient to the Western world. Russia also showed everyone that more of this will not allow, he said.
""Russian VKS in Syria - a symbol of change in the world: they proved that Russia is a great power and the world is no longer unipolar"", - the interlocutor of Sputnik Azerbaijan said.
And now, showing his power, Russia draws on his side more and more allies. The rest should be good to think about the consequences before you do something to the detriment of Russia's interests, concluded Mikhailov.",FAKE
1042,Do pacify 2500 battle tanks Russia and Transnistria?,"Moldovan politicians have launched a tough debate about the Russian and Transdniestrian settlement, while the United States sent to Eastern Europe 2500 battle tanks and artillery.
Bank conflict between Chisinau and Tiraspol
In the last few months, after the formation of the coalition in Moldova topic of relations with Russia and the Transnistrian issue provoked harsh political debate. And between Chisinau and Tiraspol unexpectedly burst bank conflict.
It was learned that on the instructions of the NBM, commercial banks the right bank closes the account of Transnistrian enterprises. This was done under the pretext that the legal entities of the region violated banking laws, conducted dubious financial transactions and even sponsored terrorists. In Tiraspol, rejected this information and stated that since Kishinev has returned to the practice of organizing economic blockades. closing accounts does not allow enterprises to conduct foreign economic activity, lead to a halt in production, social tensions complicate the difficult lives of ordinary citizens. Of course, it will not contribute to the progress in relations between the two shores.
Dodon is the fire itself
In Chisinau, representatives of non-governmental sector, the right policy and service their media claim that Russia offered Moldova to return to the ""Kozak Memorandum"", imposes the federalization of the country.
Hard political debate and has caused appearance at the UN General Assembly President Igor Dodon. Partners in the ruling coalition lashed out at the head of state, dissociated themselves from his remarks. Ostensibly the president has expressed consolidated opinion and voiced demand for the withdrawal from the territory of the Russian military and arms. Rough attacks followed and caught by the Democrats in opposition. Dodon accused that he did not condemn Russian aggression and from the rostrum and spoke in Russian, and his speech was allegedly written outside of Moldova and the Romanian language.
President's criticism was predictable
The fact that the performance of Igor Dodon, the UN cause in the Moldovan political circles tough debate was to be expected.
First, the head of the Moldovan state has its own vision of foreign policy, relations with Russia and the settlement of the Transnistrian problem. Earlier this year, at an international security conference in Munich Dodon presented the so-called ""Great package for Moldova"". This ""package"" is an original proposal to the big players change their approach towards Moldova, not drag it into geopolitical confrontation, confirm and guarantee the principle of permanent neutrality, as well as to join efforts to solve the Transnistrian problem.
Secondly, the very new ruling coalition MDBGS-ACUM emerged with the support of major international powers - Russia, EU, USA - and is an attempt of building balanced relationships with external partners. And unlike the past ten years we have seen a transition from a policy of confrontation with Russia to establish normal and fruitful relations of Moldova and the Russian Federation. There was a small ""thaw"", and a certain segment of the Chisinau politicians it was not to their liking.
Third, even before the trip coalition partners warned Igor Dodon, that if he will express their views, not ""general"", the Government and the ACUM dissociate themselves from the statements of the President.
Did you have the choice of Dodona?
Thus, before Igor Dodon came a dilemma: how to leave a message at the UN podium? Before leaving, the president said that he determines that he speak to the General Assembly session.
It is clear that Igor Dodon and could not take another decision. On the one hand, the Prime Minister Maia Sandu acted incorrectly when demanded that Igor Dodon has performed in New York with the consolidated position of the authorities, especially with regard to the Transnistrian region. Why? Yet in the coalition MDBGS-ACUM block it is like a ""junior partner."" The Socialists gained the most seats in parliament. This means that they represent a very large segment of society positions and have every right to voice where whatever the position of the voters. In addition, an attempt to publicly belittle the role and authority of the Head of State and to exalt his own very similar to the actions of the Democratic Party with their dismissal of the President on the ""five minutes"". Also in such actions dictate contains an element that is unacceptable from an ethical point of view and strategic mistake if the aim is to make the best use possible of the existing coalition.
On the other hand, and more important, Igor Dodon was elected president by popular vote rather than by parliament. In this sense, his mandate is much broader than that of the speaker of parliament or head of government. And the president is obliged to reflect the program, which was supported by the citizens, by voting for him. That's why it can be argued that in this case Igor Dodon made the right decision and verified, and its coalition partners have acted wisely and do not, and is not correct.
A departure from the tough talk
This is confirmed by the provisions of speeches, which caused fierce polemics.
One of the main points - Igor Dodon has not stated strongly at the UN that Russia must withdraw its troops and munitions from Transnistria. This is the official position of the Moldovan authorities, and it certainly ought to sound once again. But the head of state as Maya said Sandhu, did not have the courage for that. In fact, it had the courage not to use harsh rhetoric and articulate positions that are misleading and a wide global audience and do the Moldovan authorities with society.
The episode of the Russian military presence in Transnistria is a consequence of the collapse of the USSR, not premeditated occupied territories. Between Chisinau and Tiraspol, armed conflict broke out, and where there were hostilities, settled part of the 14th Army (later OGRF). Currently, Chisinau has no control over the region. This is a very important point. Between Moldova and Russia there is an agreement in 1992, which sets out the principles for a peaceful settlement of the armed conflict and Pridnestrovie. Article 4 of the agreement, the parties have stated that ""the question of the status of the army, the manner and the timing of its phasing-out will be determined in negotiations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Moldova.""
Negotiations or war declarations?
Despite the fact that negotiations on the withdrawal of weapons and troops on a permanent basis is not carried out, and the Moldovan side only resorted to declarations and ultimatums, the output process gradually occurs. As is known, the number of personnel was reduced from 6,500 to 1100. In 2001 began recycling of ammunition and weapons, but it was stopped due to failure of a political settlement of the Transnistrian conflict and the beginning of the confrontation, expressed in the economic, diplomatic, information and communication wars. Environment itself more than 15 years was not favorable for the process. And recently, Moscow has offered to resume ammunition disposal in the village of sausage and begin negotiations on all aspects of the problem.
What is reasonable in this situation: to bring down an international rostrum once again diatribes against Russia - or offer constructive international mechanisms able to see it through?
Recall that in September 2005, from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly, Vladimir Voronin (then president) called for a ""full and unconditional"" withdrawal of Russian troops from Transnistria. The last time a similar declaration was made last year, the then Prime Minister Pavel Filip. Whether Voronin made with Philip some result? No. There is therefore a real way - negotiations between the parties, and poor decision - war declarations.
The last option is just not requires courage and extend Russian military presence in the Transnistrian region. Dodon has offered to be rational and to abandon the confrontational rhetoric, causing damage to the cause. Apparently, this angered his ""partners"" in the coalition, as well as Democrats, who offer to act in the framework of the scheme have not justified themselves.
The international factor
Of course, there are other points, Igor Dodon announced by the UN, which caused a negative reaction on the coalition partners. And the community is important to understand - why?
First of all, this thesis on international guarantees of neutrality of Moldova and the role of the international factor in the settlement of the Transnistrian problem.
Why Igor Dodon brings these two initiatives (as they are part of the ""Big Package for Moldova"") is quite clear. As we remember, in 2003 Chisinau and Tiraspol were very close to resolving the conflict. With the mediation of Dmitry Kozak's side produced a road map. Everything was ready for signing, but the West, primarily the United States, began to exert strong pressure on Chisinau. And the Moldovan side refused the negotiated settlement plan.
In addition, Chisinau and Tiraspol are negotiating among themselves in international format ""5 + 2"". Where five - Russia, Ukraine, OSCE (guarantees) and the European Union, the United States (the observers). Thus, the international involvement in resolving the Transnistrian problem - the most important part of the negotiation process. But, in addition, such an approach is consistent with the emerging before our eyes multipolarity. The fact that Igor Dodon is appealing to external players, is quite natural, if only because of their own party to agree on anything, and can not constantly bogged down in conflicts.
Neutrality and lack of internal consensus
Maia Sandu argues that one can not ""big players"" to suggest ""that they agreed on the future of our country, bypassing us. This is wrong, this question must address citizens of the country. "" Ideally, of course, Maia Sandu right. But 28 years, we have clearly shown that the Moldovan citizens about what they can not agree. Some want unification with Romania, while others (Transnistria) unification with Russia, and others - to develop the state, the fourth - to join NATO and the EU, which in turn implies the renunciation of sovereignty and neutrality. Harmony in the society there. Therefore momentum needed from the outside, but also considerable financial means to find and implement stable settlement formula.
And to begin this process without international military neutrality guarantees does not make any sense. If Transnistria sees that Moldova is drawn into cooperation with NATO is trying to integrate its army with the Romanian allows special services of foreign states to shape national security policy, and to act here at home, the negotiations with Chisinau to Tiraspol lose all meaning.
Therefore, Igor Dodon and attaches so much importance to the country's neutrality. This constitutional provision, and the change may cause the country's disintegration. But ACUM leaders claim that they can not ""for the sake of settling the Transnistrian conflict to give up our goal sooner or later, to achieve integration into the EU."" And therefore, NATO.
As you can see, the very criticism of the proposals domestically Igor Dodon shows us that the level of readiness of the Moldovan politicians to compromise if not zero, then strive for it.
Myths and speculation instead of concrete steps
And in fact the president's speech at the UN acted as a litmus test for the current ruling coalition, as it affected the basic issues for the country: the Transnistrian conflict settlement, neutrality, relations with Russia. We have seen that the positions and approaches MDBGS and ACUM too different. The desire to resolve differences and move forward on the basis of a reasonable and pragmatic solutions, using a ""window of opportunity"", not visible.
As regards the Transnistrian settlement expressed compromised previous program authority. For example, the platform leader DA Andrei Nastase again persuaded to do the ""democratization, demilitarization, decriminalization and deoligarhizatsiey Transnistria"". Although the Chisinau has only begun to decriminalize certain areas of life and can not produce real results. only the intentions voiced. Instead of concrete steps to resolve the society are thrown into the myths and speculation. For example, it argues that Moscow once again promotes the ""Kozak memorandum"" and sought the federalization of Moldova. Although neither at what levels and areas Russia is not officially offered Moldova a settlement formula. And NGOs funded by the West to impose the idea that Russia uses Transnistria as a model of ""frozen"" conflicts and promoting solutions when the territory with a population of 4 percent vested ""right of veto against integration with the West» (https://balkaninsight.com/2019 / 09/26 / russia-pulls-transnistria-strings-with-eye-on-ukraine /).
As you can see, in order to maintain their allegations ""experts"" do not avoid manipulation of the figures (in Transnistria is home to about 450,000, in Moldova - 2.9 million).
Thousands of tanks moving eastward
A new military reality is formed between on the western edge of Moldova. NATO is constantly increasing, and the size of the arms creates special forces secret base, carries on the borders with Russia among the major teachings of others. And the other day from the port of Jacksonville (JAXPORT) United States sent to Europe in 2500 battle tanks and artillery. Destination - Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltic States, Poland. It is the largest relocation of military equipment since 2003, when carried out military campaign in Iraq. Clear and the purpose of these actions - to intimidate Russia. Chisinau should understand that the chance to improve relations with Russia exists only for as long as Moldova maintains its neutral status and not ""friends"" with someone against someone.",FAKE
1043,"Morozov protested the Baltic countries, Georgia, Ukraine against the Russian delegation to PACE is meaningless","The senator believes that the work of the PACE will not be interrupted because of a few little what it represents, countries, because in Europe there are more serious problems.
Partial or complete refusal of delegations of some countries to participate in the autumn session of PACE will not affect the work of the Assembly, as the issues which Europe has set itself, requires the participation of Russia, he said in an interview Sputnik Lithuania member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Federation Council Igor Morozov.
Latvian delegation to PACE once again protested against the restoration of voting rights in Russia. Previously, delegates Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia together with the representatives of Ukraine made a decision to boycott the opening of the autumn session of PACE. Lithuanian delegation will be presented partly. The delegation of Latvia refuses to participate in the plenary meetings of the session, but will continue to work in the political groups and committees and the Georgian delegation will not participate in the work of the PACE in its entirety. The MP stressed that the decision was taken in protest against Russia's return to the organization. In turn, the Estonian delegation announced its intention to still take part in the Assembly, because ""in this difficult situation in Estonia is necessary to engage in dialogue.""
Senator in this regard said that the PACE work will not be interrupted because of a few little what it represents, countries. ""I believe that the 70th anniversary of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly will be noted in any case, regardless of the boycott of the small countries, which of themselves are little on the European political scene"" - the senator said.
According to him, today the European agenda are important questions that need to be discussed, including with Russia.
""It seems to me that the leaders of these countries are not ready for a dialogue with the Russian Federation."" Caravan of history ""continues to move.

According to the senator, no one will go towards Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltic countries, as their position did not fit ""in the general trend of a full understanding of the main challenges for Europe"".

1044,"""A fundamental change in the balance of forces"": why the Ukraine started talking about the ""reversal"" of the West towards Russia","Western countries have radically changed their position on the Ukraine, going to side with Russia. This point of view was expressed by the director of the Foreign Policy Institute of the Diplomatic Academy of the MFA of Ukraine Grigory Perepelitsa. He also pointed out that this trend is the weakening of the West and to strengthen Russia. Earlier, the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Vadim Pristayko stated ""the degradation of sanctions"" against Moscow and noted the West's unwillingness to comply with previously entered restriction. Experts believe that Ukraine was originally assigned the role of ""leverage"" on Russia, but is now on the first place there is a pragmatic position that the need to improve relations with Russia. In recent years, Western countries have radically changed their position on the Ukraine and ""took the side of Russia,"" to strengthen its geopolitical position. Such an opinion in live internet channel UkrLife expressed by Director of the Foreign Policy Institute of the Diplomatic Academy of the MFA of Ukraine Grigory Perepelitsa.
""There has been a radical change in the balance of power in the international environment - a sharp weakening of the West and the strengthening of Russia. And this trend is gaining momentum, ""- said Perepelitsa.
According to him, the strengthening of Moscow's position is partly due to the fact that Russia is ""fill the vacuum"", resulting in the weakening of US influence around the world, including the post-Soviet space. Perepelitsa noted that the US president, Donald Trump is interested in cooperation with Russia, and said that the French leader Emmanuel Macron has recently outlined the intention to improve relations with Moscow.
""The West is absolutely, 180 degrees, has changed its position on Ukraine ... Now he's on the side of Russia"", - said the director of the Foreign Policy Institute.
In this situation, he believes Perepelitsa, Ukraine remains to strengthen its armed forces and move to ""active defense."" It should be noted that in mid-September, the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Vadim Pristayko expressed the opinion that the Western countries is becoming increasingly difficult to adhere to the anti-Russian sanctions. This he said in an interview with German weekly Die Welt.
The Minister said that the entered restriction ""not perfect"" and ""sanctions front"" in the West weakens. The manifestation of this trend, he saw, in particular, in the restoration of Russian authority in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), as well as in the discussion about the possible return of the Moscow G8.
Later, in an interview with ""European truth"", he explained in detail its point of view, noting ""degradation"" anti-Russian sanctions. Pristayko added that the sanctions thus fall apart as a holistic mechanism.
""PACE decision, the invitation to the OSCE meeting of representatives of the so-called Crimean organizations - all these failures, spilling, falling pieces of major sanctions mechanism. All this - the degradation of the sanctions "", - said the Minister. ""We are concerned when we say,"" Well, how? Here pereutverdim sanctions, there is the last round for another six months. "" We say, ""Perhaps pereutverdite, but ideologically sanctions are beginning to fall apart,"" - added Pristayko.
It should be noted that the delegation of Ukraine expressed protest in connection with the return of Russia to the Assembly and refused to participate in the autumn session of the advisory body, which will be held from 30 September to 4 October.
""The above is a way to respond to the Russian Federation of Ukraine return to the session hall without meeting the requirements of PACE Assembly resolutions, approved in response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine"", - says the statement of the delegation.
Russia and the West's relations
The formal reason for the sharp deterioration in relations between Russia and the West was the situation around Ukraine, where, after a coup in 2014 civil war broke out. Kiev has repeatedly accused Moscow of the fact that it allegedly involved in the conflict in the east. However, in the Russian Federation consistently emphasize the groundlessness of such rhetoric as Russia - are not the subject, and the guarantor of the Minsk agreement, whose main task is to resolve the conflict in Donbas.
Also in the spring of 2014 the Crimea and Sevastopol reunited with Russia after a referendum in which the vast majority of inhabitants of the peninsula were in favor of entry into the Russian Federation. However, despite the open character of the referendum, the West accused Russia of annexing Crimea and introduced restriction. Moscow responded kontrsanktsii installed by going to the realization of the import substitution strategy. However, Russia repeatedly stated at the highest level, that is counterproductive to speak in the language of sanctions.
""With regard to sanctions is counterproductive and senseless actions, especially with regard to a country such as Russia"", - stated Vladimir Putin in August 2018, commenting on the expansion of the United States of restrictive measures.
Speaking about the role of Ukraine in relations between Russia and the West, a professor of HSE Alexander Domrin noted that certain political circles initially diverted Kiev specific role in this scheme.
""Ukraine is, of course, the West as such has never needed except as a"" battering ram ""and"" battle-ax ""against Russia ... Just because of this, Ukraine was of interest to the United States,"" - said the expert.
At the same time RT interlocutor drew attention to the pragmatism with which the relations with Russia are trying to approach a number of Western leaders.
""There is France, and for whatever we might ironically treated Macron, his pragmatism is in favor of the normalization of Russian-French relations. With regard Trump - from the very beginning of his campaign talked about the normalization of relations with Russia "", - said Domrin.
Recall that during the meeting with Putin in August 2019 Macron said that the era of Western hegemony is coming to an end, and urged to improve relations with Moscow. According to Domrina similar pragmatism of US leadership and France it suggests that there is great potential for normalization of relations between Russia and these countries. However, there are examples of other positions.
""As for many other Western countries, the Baltic countries the same, for example, or Poland, there is no pragmatism never outweigh their Russophobia"", - the expert believes.
In turn, the US director of the Research Foundation of the Franklin Roosevelt at MSU Yuri Rogulov also expressed the view that the West is in a situation with Ukraine first of all pursued their own interests.
""In international relations, naive to expect that foreign interests would stand above his. Of course, the West pursued their own interests. He clothed them in their respective ideological and political form, but primarily Radel for their interests and interests of the EU "", - the expert said.
But now, according to RT interlocutor think it came down to the fact that Western countries have to make a decision on the need to invest significant funds for the continuation of this ""project"".
""Spending money or whose plans are not included. Because they initially pursued their own interests. And (the fact is that) they have always supported and will support Ukraine as a ""counterweight"" or ""leverage"" on Russia ... In Ukraine, now simply goes revaluation of all that is happening, ""- concluded the expert.",FAKE

The version of ""Russia's fault in the death of"" Boeing ""begins to crumble
Dutch MPs finally, after more than five years after the catastrophe, ""Boeing"" Flight MH17 in the Donbass, Ukraine's role demanded an investigation - and thus demonstrate the rightness of his behavior saying ""better late than never."" Five years Moscow urged to investigate this tragedy, and not to drive in the facts into the Procrustean bed ""to blame Russia."" Five years of the Netherlands, like other European countries, have ignored these calls.
Although, of course, understanding that any blame for the tragedy in the first place is the country in whose territory it happened in the Netherlands was. Recall that only this country held a referendum on the approval of the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine - and more than 61% of the Dutch voted against. Since the referendum was a ""consultative"", after some cosmetic edits kingdom still has signed the agreement, for which Ukraine has gone through a coup, the loss of territory and civil war.
It is significant that the investigation Ukrainian role in the crash ""Boeing"" demanded all the political forces represented in the Dutch Parliament. ""With regard to Ukraine's role is not clear, although the country was supposed to close the air space"", - said the deputy Michiel van IISP. According to him, it is necessary to conduct further investigations in order to achieve truth and justice in this matter.

As stated in an interview with LOOK Kornilov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands Stef Blok said last year that the legitimate reasons for engaging Ukraine has no accountability.

Russian senator Alexei Pushkov in the same social network called the demands of the Parliament of the Netherlands to study the role of Ukraine in the MH17 «dangerous for Kiev."" ""Until now the West to shield Ukraine, as"" Caesar's wife "", which is supposedly above all suspicion,"" - he wrote.
It is significant that the Ukrainian mass media have ignored the news. Of the nearly 100 sources that lead aggregator ""Yandex news"", no Ukrainian.
In this edition from the Ukraine wrote that the Prosecutor's Office of the Netherlands addressed to the Russian colleagues to facilitate interrogation Tzemach, who gave Kiev Moscow. However, the information was previously published in the media that the Tzemach after the exchange moved to Donetsk, so Russian prosecutors formally there is a reason to deny the Dutch. While perhaps in this case it would be necessary to show good faith and to provide the prosecutors of the Netherlands an opportunity to communicate with the militias.

Logically and according to pre-programmed invariable media search and promotion of the sensations, the news had a few hours to acquire commentaries, analyzes, expert statements, and so on. D. But this did not happen.
In the world media first row found better things to do than to establish the true culprit death of 298 people in July 2014. The statement of the Dutch parliament reacted only local, ie the Dutch press, and even that - be very careful.

Site investigation group - it is certainly a sample bias: ""SAM"" Buk "", from which was hit by an airliner MH17 flight, belonged to the 53 th air defense missile brigade of Kursk, the Russian Federation"", - categorically approved by the site without being more or less reliable evidence. Followed by a call to the witness to answer the question: who was a member of the crew, who commanded the crew, who gave the orders, who has photos and videos, and so on.
But how can you say that it was a ""Buk"" of the 53rd Brigade, if you do not have this information ?! Start trial is scheduled for March 9, 2020 at 10.00 am in the District Court of The Hague. It seems that its outcome will not be as unambiguous as long ago seemed to Kiev.",FAKE
