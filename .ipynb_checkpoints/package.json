        "title": "There’s no evidence Nigel Farage was in the National Front",
        "text": "A lot of people are claiming that Nigel Farage was involved in the notorious far-right National Front party as a teenager.\nThere is no evidence that this is true and the suggestion that Mr Farage was photographed alongside a National Front leader in 1979 is almost certainly untrue.\nThousands of people have shared Twitter posts of this photograph.\nThe shot dates from 1979 and forms part of the archive of the respected picture agency Getty Images. There is no reason to think it has been doctored or captioned wrongly by Getty.\nIt shows a man called Martin Webster leaving Kingston Crown Court in October 1979.\nThe caption from Getty states that Mr Webster, in the suit and tie, had just been given a six-month suspended sentence for publishing material likely to incite racial hatred.\nAt the time, Mr Webster was a leading figure in the National Front, an anti-immigration party widely condemned as white supremacist and fascist.\nSome people are now suggesting that the boy wearing the cap on Webster’s right is a young Nigel Farage. The current leader of the Brexit Party would have been 15 at the time the snap was taken.\nWhen contacted by FactCheck, an aide to Mr Farage strenuously denied it was him in the photo – and all the evidence we have seen suggests that it is not him.\nThe face\nTo our eyes, the youngster in the photo bears no more than a passing resemblance to Nigel Farage.\nIf you look at pictures of the Brexit Party leader as a teenager – like the one on the right here showing him as an 18-year-old member of the Combined Cadet Force – we would suggest that the difference in the facial features is clear.\nBut these things are in the eye of the beholder, and certainly there are many people who believe the boy walking on Martin Webster’s right could be Mr Farage.\nWhat does Martin Webster say?\nMr Webster, now in his 70s, told FactCheck: “To the best of my knowledge, Nigel Farage was never a member of the National Front. I do not believe that the lad shown in the photograph standing beside me is Nigel Farage.”\nWhile Mr Webster could not positively identify the young man, he states that he was 5ft 11.5 inches tall at the time the photo was taken, and that the youngster was significantly shorter than him.\nWould Mr Farage – now 5ft 8 inches tall – have been this short at the age of 15-and-a-half?\nThe clothes look wrong, too. In October 1979, Mr Farage was a pupil at the south London private school Dulwich College.\nMr Webster tells an interesting anecdote about some Dulwich schoolboys visiting the National Front’s headquarters and bookshop at Pawson’s Road, Croydon, at around this time.\nHe notes: “Though they wore casual dress, their clothing… was smart ‘designer’ stuff; their hair was well-cut and short — all as you would expect of lads from wealthy families attending a posh public school.\n“I would have noticed if they wore scruffy boots of the type worn by the lad in the picture.”\nHe adds: “I think that if Nigel Farage had associated himself as a young man with the NF in the 1970s, he would have got to know a few people in the party.\n“Put another way: a few people in the party would have got to know him. In view of his high profile in politics since he helped found Ukip, it is likely that his former NF associates would have gossiped about his previous involvement with the NF…\n“No such gossip about Farage has ever surfaced.”\nIt must be acknowledged that Mr Webster is a man with a long involvement in far-right politics and has never recanted his extreme political views.\nBut people on the opposite end of the political spectrum also say no evidence has emerged linking Mr Farage to far-right groups as a youngster.\nFactCheck spoke to Searchlight, the anti-fascist magazine that kept careful tabs on the activities of the National Front at the height of the party’s popularity in the 1970s.\nA senior representative of the magazine told us that rumours of Mr Farage’s involvement in far-right circles have never stood up to scrutiny.\nIn 2013, Channel 4 News ran a story based on a letter written by one of Mr Farage’s teachers at Dulwich College warning of his “racist” and “neo-fascist” views as a schoolboy.\nOther teachers at the school defended Mr Farage’s behaviour, saying he enjoyed goading left-wing teachers and was guilty of nothing worse than “naughtiness”.\nNone of the accusations in this, or similar media stories focusing on Mr Farage’s alleged behaviour as a schoolboy, have made the accusation that he was an active member of a far-right group or party like the National Front.\nMr Farage responded to the 2013 Channel 4 News story by saying that he had been a “troublemaker” who “wound people up” by expressing controversial views.\nBut he added: “Any accusation I was ever involved in far-right politics is utterly untrue.”\nSo who is the boy in the photo?\nWe have not been able to identify the young man in the photograph.\nOur fellow fact-checkers at Snopes.com have nominated Richard Verrall, former deputy chairman of the National Front, as a likely candidate, based on facial similarity.\nBut Mr Verrall – pictured here alongside Martin Webster in 1980 – was around 31 when the first photo was taken, not a slightly-built youngster.\nMr Webster told FactCheck that the boy was definitely not Mr Verrall, a close colleague of his at the time.",

        "title": "Will Russia Really Gain Control Over Ukraine's Economy?",
        "text": "On May 11, the headline of an article posted by the Russian state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti claimed an expert had said “Russia has gained control over the Ukrainian economy.”\nThe expert in question is Dmitry Marunich of the Kyiv-based Foundation for Energy Strategies, and RIA was quoting from comments he made in an interview with the Ukrainian outlet NewsOne:\n\"It is obvious that the Russian authorities have received a powerful lever of influence on the situation with deliveries and, accordingly, on the oil products market in Ukraine, with a footprint on the general state of the Ukrainian economy.\"\nMirroring a line from the NewsOne article preceding the quote RIA Novosti’s headline suggests that Russia has gained control over Ukraine’s economy. Both are inaccurate – the expert said that it had only gained powerful influence over one sector of the Ukrainian economy, albeit it is an important one. Thus, in order to fully understand why the RIA Novosti headline is deceptive, one must look at the NewsOne story it quotes, as well as the context of the interview.\nIn April, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced that he had approved a law banning all Russian oil, coal, and oil products exports to Ukraine without special permission. The ban is scheduled to go into effect on June 1. In the NewsOne interview, Marunich expressed doubt that exports will be cut off.\n“I wouldn’t predict a cessation of imports of petroleum products from the Russian Federation,” he told NewsOne. “As far as I know, a large Russian company, Rosneft, has already received permission for supplies inside Ukraine. Therefore, in all probability, there will be no cessation of supplies from June 1.”\nThe quote used by RIA Novosti about Russia gaining leverage over Ukraine’s economy came elsewhere in Marunich’s NewsOne interview.\nSo what is the prognosis for Ukraine should Russia decide to cut off oil and coal exports to Ukraine? Back in April, Ukraine Business News reported that Ukraine’s Oil and Gas Association announced that it could meet the country’s oil and gas needs from other countries. UBN quoted representatives of the association as saying that Ukraine’s supply was more diversified than some European nations.\n“Starting in 2017, fuel comes to Ukraine from more than 10 countries using all sorts of logistics – maritime, rail, road and pipeline, which allows organizing any deliveries in a short time,” the representatives stated, although they did allow for slightly higher prices at gas pumps.\nCoal is another matter. Ukraine produces coal, but part of its main coal-mining territory is under the control of Russia’s proxies in the Donbas. In 2017, protests organized by Ukrainian war veterans compelled the government to stop buying coal from these territories. However, there has been suspicions that Ukraine continued to buy the coal using Belarus as an intermediary. Ukraine also sought to import coal from the United States in 2018.\nRussia’s influence over other sectors of Ukraine’s economy has dropped since 2014. On May 12, Business News Europe reported that Poland had surpassed Russia as Ukraine’s main trading partner. Additionally, BNE, citing the State Statics Service of Ukraine, showed trade with Russia stood at 7.3% of the total in February 2018, dropping to 6.0% by February 2019. Earlier this year, BNE reported that restrictive quotas on certain exports remain a barrier still holding back Ukraine’s trade with the EU. It stands to reason that without these restrictions, Ukraine-EU trade, which has been larger than Ukraine’s trade with Russia for some time, would likely grow even more.\nIt is unclear whether Russia’s energy embargo on Ukraine will be as powerful a lever as Dmitry Marunich predicts after and if it goes into effect on June 1. What is clear, however, is that RIA Novosti’s headline proclaiming Russia’s “control” over Ukraine’s economy is misleading.",

        "text": "President Donald Trump clearly supports the oil and gas industry, but he made several false and misleading boasts about his impact on the energy sector.\nThe president suggested that a change in federal policy was responsible for a newly operational natural gas export terminal, saying past leaders’ “anti-American energy” policies had led the company to plan an import terminal instead. In fact, the exporting project, and several others like it, were approved by the Obama administration.\nTrump falsely claimed that liquefied natural gas exports were “heading south” before he took office. They increased more than 500 percent in President Barack Obama’s final year in office, as the first major exporting project began operations.\nHe said U.S. energy exports “brought down our trade deficit by $215 billion.” That’s wrong. Energy exports have been rising, but the U.S. still imports more than it exports, and the overall trade deficit in goods and services went up by nearly 13 percent in 2018.\nTrump spoke in Hackberry, Louisiana, on May 14 at the opening of Sempra Energy’s Cameron LNG project, a liquefied natural gas exporting facility.\nLNG Project Approved by Obama Administration\nCameron LNG is the fourth liquefied natural gas exporting project in the Lower 48 states to begin operations since 2016. All were approved under the Obama administration, after the “shale revolution” took hold, when technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling led to increased domestic production. These LNG facilities cool the natural gas into a liquid form and ship it to markets in Asia and Europe.\nSempra Energy announced its plan to create an LNG export terminal in 2012 in a partnership with Japanese companies, and as its website says: “The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the project in June 2014.”\nBut Trump claimed a change in federal policy was the reason for Sempra’s facility.\nTrump, May 14: It was not long ago that Sempra planned to build a natural gas import terminal on this very spot. That was in the past, when our leaders pursued policies that were anti-American energy and anti-American worker and anti-America wealth. It all ended. But those days are over. Now we have an America First energy policy, just like we have an America First policy.\nWe asked the White House press office what “anti-American energy” policies had affected Sempra’s plans to build exporting facilities, and we didn’t get a response.\nBut the record shows Sempra started its shift from an import terminal, which opened in 2009, to exporting in 2012 and received the appropriate approvals under the Obama administration. Experts told us it takes anywhere from four to six years to build these facilities.\nWe asked Sempra about the president’s comment, and we received an email response from Kelli Mleczko, corporate communications advisor, who said: “You are correct, Cameron LNG was approved in 2014.”",

        "text": "President Donald Trump and his son Eric both took shots this week at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, saying crime has risen in the city under his leadership. That’s wrong, according to crime data kept by the New York Police Department.\nMajor felony offenses have dropped every year de Blasio has served as the city’s mayor, according to New York Police Department data. Other felonies are down. Misdemeanors are down. Arrests are down.\nAccording to FBI crime data, New York City had a lower violent crime rate than all but two other cities with a population over 1 million in 2017.\nNonetheless, in a Twitter spat with de Blasio on May 14, Eric Trump claimed that under de Blasio’s leadership “crime is up” in New York City.\nEric Trump\n✔\n@EricTrump\n Spare me? First you have never created a job in your life. Second, our great city has gone to shit under your leadership.

That prompted President Trump to sarcastically tweet that “if you like high taxes & crime, he’s your man.”\nDonald J. Trump\n✔\n@realDonaldTrump\n The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the U.S., will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he’s your man. NYC HATES HIM!\n128K\n3:33 PM - May 16, 2019\nTwitter Ads info and privacy\n59.4K people are talking about this\nWhether “NYC HATES HIM! [de Blasio]” as the president claims, is a matter of opinion, of course. De Blasio was reelected mayor in 2017 with 66 percent of the vote, but according to an April Quinnipiac poll, 76 percent of New Yorkers didn’t want him to run for president, and only 42 percent approve of how he is handling his current job as mayor. .\nWe’ll get to some of the other claims made by the Trumps about de Blasio’s record, but let’s start with crime in New York City, which data indicate is historically low.\nCrime Isn’t Up\nAs a mayoral candidate in 2013, de Blasio vowed to end the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a get-tough-on-crime tactic of stopping people for suspicious activity that was begun under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and expanded under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. As it faced court challenges, the policy was well on its way out by the time de Blasio took office in early 2014, but it was greatly reduced during de Blasio’s tenure.\nAccording to online “Stop, Question and Frisk” data kept by the NYPD, those kinds of stops were at nearly 700,000 in 2011, but had declined to about 192,000 in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, and to nearly 46,000 in 2014. They continued to decline under de Blasio’s time as mayor, dipping to about 11,000 in 2018.\nAlthough many critics warned it would spur a return to higher crime rates, that didn’t happen.\n“Crime is definitely not up under de Blasio,” said Patrick Sharkey, a sociology professor at New York University, who created a website that tracks data on murder for large cities.\n“The best measure of crime that we have is the murder rate,” Sharkey told us. “Under de Blasio, the murder rate has stayed very consistent but overall, it has fallen slightly — it rose a bit in 2015 and 2016 and fell in 2017 and 2018. Last year was the lowest point for the city’s murder rate on record. Over 2,000 people were murdered in New York City in each year of the early 1990s, and last year there were 295 murders.\n“New York City is now one of the 3 or 4 safest big cities (500,000 or more people) in the country,” Sharkey said in an email. “Perhaps more important, de Blasio has overseen a complete transformation of policing in the city. He ended the use of stop, question, and frisk as a central tactic of policing — about 12,000 people were stopped by the NYPD last year, compared to roughly 700,000 at the peak before he took office. Arrests are down and summonses are also way down. I view the transformation of policing (and the criminal justice system) in NYC as a proof of concept for cities trying to find ways to keep violence low while also reducing the impact of the [criminal justice] system and the harm done by aggressive policing.”\nAccording to data from the NYPD, the total number of the seven major felony offenses — murder/manslaughter, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny of a motor vehicle — has gradually declined every year under de Blasio’s time as mayor. Those types of crime dropped from 111,335 in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, to 95,883 in 2018. That’s a nearly 14 percent drop.\nThe number of murders, 295 in 2018, was up three from 2017, but down nearly 12 percent from the number in 2013. Robberies, burglaries, and grand larcenies and car thefts are all down. The number of felony assaults has remained about the same. And the number of rapes — 1,794 in 2018 — has gone up 30 percent since 2013.\nThe total number of “Non Seven Major Felonies” is also down. Those crimes — which include possession of stolen property, forgery/identity theft, arson, sex crimes, felony drug and weapons offenses, and criminal mischief — dropped 8.6 percent between 2013 and 2018, to 52,667.\nAnd the number of misdemeanors declined 24.4 percent between 2013 and 2018, to 271,630. That includes possession of stolen property, drugs and weapons, as well as driving while intoxicated and criminal trespass.\nThe number of arrests is also down. According to data kept by the state, total arrests in New York City have declined every year under de Blasio, going from 313,513 in 2013 to 205,556 in 2018 — a 34 percent drop. Broken down, there was a nearly 13 percent drop in felony arrests over that period and a 43 percent drop in misdemeanor arrests.\nIn 2017, the latest full year available for city-specific data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report, New York City had the third lowest violent crime rate among the 11 cities with a population of more than 1 million. The city’s violent crime rate that year — 539 violent crimes per 100,000 population — was the lowest since at least 1985, the last year available on the UCR’s online search tool.\n“Crime rates are down for murder and most other interpersonal crimes of violence and theft (other than rapes — where the reporting rate by victims may have increased),” Andrew Karmen, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, told us via email.\nThose declines came even as de Blasio greatly scaled back “the harsh tactics pursued by Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg for 20 years” — “excessive stopping and frisking” and “excessive arresting for minor quality of life infractions,” Karmen said.\n“In other words, even though the NYPD under de Blasio’s two [police] commissioners was compelled to cut back on the two ‘get tough’ approaches touted by Giuliani and Bloomberg as absolutely necessary to maintain public safety, the crime rates in NYC have continued to drift downward, as they have since 1990,” Karmen said. “They certainly have not shot up as hardliners predicted and as Trump has mistakenly tweeted.”\nFleeing NYC?\nAs for Eric Trump’s claim that “people are leaving our city in record numbers,” the city’s population of 8.4 million in 2018 was nearly identical to what it was in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, according to U.S. Census estimates. But there’s more to the story than that.\nAfter rising during de Blasio’s first couple years in office, New York City’s total population declined between 2016 and 2017, and again between 2017 and 2018 — the first time the city had seen a decline in total population in more than a decade.\nAlthough the city’s population has remained about the same during de Blasio’s time in office, the city has been “losing” people in the sense that there are more people moving out of the city than are moving in from other parts of the United States, explained Frank Donnelly, the geospatial data librarian at Baruch College CUNY and co-author of the 2018 paper, “New Yorkers on the Move: Recent Migration Trends for the City and Metro Area.”\nBut that’s not new under de Blasio. The net domestic out-migration, as it is called, is a long, historical trend, Donnelly told us via email.\nSo how has the population of New York City mostly climbed over the last decade despite the net domestic out-migration? “In the 21st century this loss has been offset by natural increase (more births than deaths in the city) plus a large influx of foreign migrants,” Donnelly explained. “These outweigh any loss in domestic migration and have been the reason why NYC has been growing.”\nIn the last two years, foreign immigration has dipped (from 63,223 in 2016 to just under 50,000 in 2017 and 2018) and net domestic out-migration has climbed (from 71,314 in 2013, the year before he took office, to 137,191 in 2018). “This tipped the scales from growth to loss,” Donnelly said.\nBut for Eric Trump to claim that people are “leaving the city in record numbers” is embellishment, Donnelly said. “Domestic out-migration this decade hasn’t been as high as it was in the late 20th century,” Donnelly said, as “lots of young people have been moving to the city, offsetting people moving out to some degree.”\n“Most experts would agree that NYC population growth has been strong in the 21st century – certainly not the high growth you see in cities down South and out West, but exceptional for an older Northeastern city that’s built out and densely populated,” Donnelly said.\nJobs\nAs for Eric Trump’s claim that “you have never created a job in your life,” we assume Trump was talking about as an employer. But what about de Blasio’s record as mayor? Responding via Twitter, de Blasio said, “NYC’s jobs are at record highs.”\nWe have long cautioned readers about taking boasts of all-time highs in employment with a grain of salt, that it is not such a remarkable accomplishment when the population continues to rise. We also have repeatedly warned that elected officials often get too much credit and blame for employment trends, which are often driven by forces outside their control.\nWith those caveats, we note that the number of people employed in New York City increased from 4,087,900 in January 2014 — the month de Blasio took office — to 4,650,400 in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a 13.8 percent increase, better than the national 9.8 percent increase over the same period.\nThe unemployment rate in New York City went from 8.1 percent in January 2014, when de Blasio took office, and has steadily declined to 4.3 percent in April. Nationally, the unemployment rate went from 6.6 percent in January 2014 to 3.6 percent in April.",

        "text": "President Donald Trump and his son Eric both took shots this week at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, saying crime has risen in the city under his leadership. That’s wrong, according to crime data kept by the New York Police Department.\nMajor felony offenses have dropped every year de Blasio has served as the city’s mayor, according to New York Police Department data. Other felonies are down. Misdemeanors are down. Arrests are down.\nAccording to FBI crime data, New York City had a lower violent crime rate than all but two other cities with a population over 1 million in 2017.\nNonetheless, in a Twitter spat with de Blasio on May 14, Eric Trump claimed that under de Blasio’s leadership “crime is up” in New York City.\nEric Trump\n✔\n@EricTrump\n Spare me? First you have never created a job in your life. Second, our great city has gone to shit under your leadership. Crime is up, the men & women of the NYPD detest you, homelessness is rampant, our streets are dirty and people are leaving our city in record numbers.\nMayor Bill de Blasio\n✔\n@NYCMayor\nSpare me.

Trump\n✔\n@realDonaldTrump\n The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the U.S., will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he’s your man. NYC HATES HIM!\n128K\n3:33 PM - May 16, 2019\nTwitter Ads info and privacy\n59.4K people are talking about this\nWhether “NYC HATES HIM! [de Blasio]” as the president claims, is a matter of opinion, of course. De Blasio was reelected mayor in 2017 with 66 percent of the vote, but according to an April Quinnipiac poll, 76 percent of New Yorkers didn’t want him to run for president, and only 42 percent approve of how he is handling his current job as mayor. .\nWe’ll get to some of the other claims made by the Trumps about de Blasio’s record, but let’s start with crime in New York City, which data indicate is historically low.\nCrime Isn’t Up\nAs a mayoral candidate in 2013, de Blasio vowed to end the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a get-tough-on-crime tactic of stopping people for suspicious activity that was begun under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and expanded under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. As it faced court challenges, the policy was well on its way out by the time de Blasio took office in early 2014, but it was greatly reduced during de Blasio’s tenure.\nAccording to online “Stop, Question and Frisk” data kept by the NYPD, those kinds of stops were at nearly 700,000 in 2011, but had declined to about 192,000 in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, and to nearly 46,000 in 2014. They continued to decline under de Blasio’s time as mayor, dipping to about 11,000 in 2018.\nAlthough many critics warned it would spur a return to higher crime rates, that didn’t happen.\n“Crime is definitely not up under de Blasio,” said Patrick Sharkey, a sociology professor at New York University, who created a website that tracks data on murder for large cities.\n“The best measure of crime that we have is the murder rate,” Sharkey told us. “Under de Blasio, the murder rate has stayed very consistent but overall, it has fallen slightly — it rose a bit in 2015 and 2016 and fell in 2017 and 2018. Last year was the lowest point for the city’s murder rate on record. Over 2,000 people were murdered in New York City in each year of the early 1990s, and last year there were 295 murders.\n“New York City is now one of the 3 or 4 safest big cities (500,000 or more people) in the country,” Sharkey said in an email. “Perhaps more important, de Blasio has overseen a complete transformation of policing in the city. He ended the use of stop, question, and frisk as a central tactic of policing — about 12,000 people were stopped by the NYPD last year, compared to roughly 700,000 at the peak before he took office. Arrests are down and summonses are also way down. I view the transformation of policing (and the criminal justice system) in NYC as a proof of concept for cities trying to find ways to keep violence low while also reducing the impact of the [criminal justice] system and the harm done by aggressive policing.”\nAccording to data from the NYPD, the total number of the seven major felony offenses — murder/manslaughter, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny of a motor vehicle — has gradually declined every year under de Blasio’s time as mayor. Those types of crime dropped from 111,335 in 2013, the year before de Blasio took office, to 95,883 in 2018. That’s a nearly 14 percent drop.\nThe number of murders, 295 in 2018, was up three from 2017, but down nearly 12 percent from the number in 2013. Robberies, burglaries, and grand larcenies and car thefts are all down. The number of felony assaults has remained about the same. And the number of rapes — 1,794 in 2018 — has gone up 30 percent since 2013.\nThe total number of “Non Seven Major Felonies” is also down. Those crimes — which include possession of stolen property, forgery/identity theft, arson, sex crimes, felony drug and weapons offenses, and criminal mischief — dropped 8.6 percent between 2013 and 2018, to 52,667.\nAnd the number of misdemeanors declined 24.4 percent between 2013 and 2018, to 271,630. That includes possession of stolen property, drugs and weapons, as well as driving while intoxicated and criminal trespass.\nThe number of arrests is also down. According to data kept by the state, total arrests in New York City have declined every year under de Blasio, going from 313,513 in 2013 to 205,556 in 2018 — a 34 percent drop.

        "title": "Are the vast majority of asylum claims without merit?",
        "text": "During an appearance on\" The View\" in early May, U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw sparred with host Sunny Hostin as they discussed border security and immigration issues.\n\"Aren’t you bunching everyone together when you’re talking about undocumented immigrants?\" Hostin said to Crenshaw, a Republican from Houston, who was discussing new reports about the number of people apprehended in recent months after crossing the border illegally.\n\"Many of these people are seeking asylum,\" she said. \"What happened to our country’s promise of give me your tired, your weak and your poor; people who are truly coming here to seek a better life?\"  \n\"As it turns out, about 80 to 90 percent of those don’t have a valid asylum claim, once we actually get their documentation,\" Crenshaw said in reply.\nThis isn’t the first time PolitiFact has checked a claim about the percentage of asylum claims that are valid — we rated a similar statement from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions false last year.  \nThe truth is, about 20 to 30 percent of asylum requests have been granted annually since 2009, but experts said that does not mean that the remaining 70 to 80 percent of cases are invalid. There are many reasons why an asylum case might otherwise be dismissed or closed.\nAsylum claims\nBefore we dive into the numbers, let’s take a look at the two main processes for seeking asylum, as outlined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security:\nAffirmative asylum: a person living in the United States can voluntarily apply for asylum through this process — regardless of their immigration status or how they arrived in the country.\nDefensive asylum: a person can apply for asylum through this process to avoid being removed from the country — this process can only be pursued by people who are in removal proceedings.\nDefensive asylum claims can include those filed by individuals who were apprehended at the border while attempting to enter the country without authorization or by people here illegally who were apprehended by law enforcement officials within the country (at a traffic stop, for example).\nCrenshaw’s office directed us to a report from the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the Justice Department that looked at asylum cases that originated with a \"Credible Fear Claim,\" which falls under the defensive asylum process.  \nThese claims originate from individuals who were apprehended by Border Patrol officers while attempting to enter the country without authorization and were placed into the expedited removal process.\nIf a person in these circumstances claims to have a credible fear of persecution or torture if they were to be removed from the country, they meet with an asylum officer who determines whether to refer their case to an immigration judge for a full hearing. Once a case is referred to a judge, a person must submit an application for asylum to the court.\nThe Justice Department data shows that in fiscal 2018, asylum was granted in 16% of cases that originated from a credible fear claim. About 29% of requests were denied and roughly 15% of cases were closed for administrative or other reasons.\nIn the remaining 40 percent of cases, individuals who were booked with a credible fear claim did not end up submitting an application for asylum.\nWhile just 16 percent of these cases resulted in asylum being granted, experts said there are many reasons why cases might be closed or requests might be denied, regardless of the merits of a claim.\nAnd just because an individual does not submit an asylum application after a credible fear interview does not mean that they do not have a valid asylum claim, according to Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\"One of the reasons it is so common to see people who pass the credible fear test and don’t ultimately apply for asylum is that they don’t know that they have to and are confused about the process,\" Pierce said.\nSome asylum seekers assume that their credible fear interview with an asylum officer is their application for asylum, since they are allowed to enter the country while they await their court date, Pierce said. But in actuality, they have to submit a paper application to the court formally requesting asylum.\nLooking at the roughly 15% of cases that were closed for unspecified reasons, Pierce said that this group could include individuals who applied for other benefits before an immigration court at the same time as they sought asylum and were granted those other benefits instead.\n\"When you’re in front of an immigration judge, there’s no limit to what you can ask for,\" Pierce said. \"When I first started practicing, my old boss used to say that I should throw as many wet noodles at the wall as I can to see what sticks.\"\nSimilar points were raised by the experts we consulted in our 2018 fact-check of a similar claim from Sessions.\nJennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School, said cases can be dismissed for a number of reasons unrelated to the merits of an individual’s claim.\n\"Many cases are denied for procedural reasons not related to the merit of the claim, or because the applicants are unrepresented or poorly represented and therefore don't have the chance to make their case in an effective way,\" she told PolitiFact.\nJames Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan Law School, said it’s also important to count the number of cases that were reversed through the available appeals processes.\nThe same is true for all asylum cases\nAnother important caveat to consider is that credible fear claims do not make up the majority of the asylum cases that come before judges in the United States.\nJustice Department numbers show that, of all asylum cases closed in 2017 (the latest year with complete data available), about 20% of claims were granted and about 34% were denied. The remaining cases were closed or dismissed for unspecified reasons.\nRegardless of which dataset you consult, experts said the same things are true: just because a case is denied does not mean an individual does not have a valid claim (cases can be denied for procedural reasons unrelated to the merits of a claim); asylum cases can be closed or dismissed for many reasons, none of which invalidate an individual’s claim; and just because someone does not apply for asylum after claiming credible fear does not mean their asylum claim is not credible.\nOur ruling\nCrenshaw said that about 80 to 90 percent of individuals seeking asylum do not have a valid claim.\nWhile data shows that in 2018 about 16% of asylum cases that originate from a credible fear claim were granted and about 20% of all asylum claims were granted, experts said this does not mean that the remaining cases do not have merit.\nCrenshaw would have been accurate to say that 16% of people who apply for asylum after making a claim of credible fear have an eligible asylum claim, but the inverse — what Crenshaw said — is inaccurate.\nWe rate this claim False.",

        "text": "A disturbing photograph of a white-tailed deer covered with large tumors is back to making the rounds on social media.\nText above the photo says, \"A deer became riddled with tumors from eating plants sprayed with Monsanto’s Roundup. It seems fairly common.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe hairless protrusions are called Cutaneous fibromas, commonly referred to as deer warts, and are found in deer herds in a majority of U.S. states, according to a report by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. As a result, the organization says, the warts are considered to exist in the entirety of the white-tailed deer range.\nBut such fibromas are not caused by \"Monsanto’s Roundup,\" or any other herbicide.\nThe warts are caused by a viral infection believed to be transmitted through various biting insects. The viral agent may also be transmitted through direct contact with damaged skin. Once the virus enters the skin, the warts have been found to start forming within about seven weeks.\nThe disease is also temporary, researchers say, and only lasts about two months before it starts to regress in most deer.\nKevin Hynes, a wildlife biologist at New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation, confirmed to PolitiFact by email that the protrusions in the photo are, in fact, fibromas.\n\"They are fairly common in N.Y. deer and are caused by a virus spread by biting insects or by direct contact; the virus does not infect humans or pets,\" Hynes wrote. \"Fibromas are typically found in younger deer and they usually regress, dry up and fall off leaving no evidence they were ever there. Fibromas only cause problems for deer if they cover the eyes or are very large and/or numerous (as in your photo) and become secondarily infected with bacteria.’\"\nWhile their appearance may be grotesque, fibromas are not typically harmful to the deer, according to a 2011 publication by the USDA National Wildlife Research Center. However, the report says, deer with heavy tumor loads may suffer from \"exhaustion and incapacitation due to tumors interfering with vision, respiration, food ingestion, and locomotion.\" Occasionally, researchers say, the fibromas can create a bacterial infection.\nWhile our efforts to find the origin of this photograph using reverse-image searches were not conclusive, fact-checking website TruthOrFiction reported it first appeared in October 2017 on a Facebook page for hunters in a post that went over the actual cause for the growths.\nRegardless of the origin, we do know that the picture shows a deer with growths that appear consistent with a condition commonly known as deer warts. The claim that such blemishes are caused by an herbicide is not true.\nWe rate this claim False.",

All the events described in the article are not real.\nThe story originated from an article published on May 13, 2019 titled \"Ocasio-Cortez Wants to Take Guns Away From Cops\" (archived here) which opened:\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is now on a nationwide campaign to take \"all means of lethal force\" from ordinary beat and patrol cops. \"They do it in England,\" said the young, naive Congresswoman, \"why can't we do it here?\"\nHer proposal would require that police carrying live, deadly force weapons be specially trained, in tactical and recognizable uniforms, and only be dispatched \"in extreme circumstances.\" In other words, if a patrolling cop comes up on a fight and someone shoots at him, he can fire back with pepper spray and bean bag rounds to his heart's content, but he has to call SWAT if he needs real backup.\nAccording to her spokesman, Art Tubolls, the idea is very popular in Democrat strongholds like New York and Chicago.\nScreenshot of https://dailyworldupdate.us/cops-with-squirt-guns-sounds-like-fun/\nUsers on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail:\nThe story was posted under the category \"AOC Fan Fiction for the Discerning Tater\" and the name \"Art Tubolls\" is an anagram for \"Busta Troll\", the owner of the site.\nThe site is part of the \"America's Last Line of Defense\" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine and his partner in crime John Prager along with a loose confederation of friends and allies.

In reaction to this he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages so they carry extremely visible disclaimers everywhere.\nEvery site in the network has an about page that reads (in part):\nAbout Satire\nBefore you complain and decide satire is synonymous with \"comedy\":\nsat·ire\nˈsaˌtī(ə)r\nnoun\nThe use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.\nEverything on this website is fiction.

Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus.\nThough it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by someone with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver's mouth mixes with food while chewing.

It is not real.\nThe story originated from an article published by LFR Solutions on May 16, 2019 titled \"WWE Legend Ric Flair Declared Brain Dead\" (archived here) which opened:\nWWE Ric Flair has been declared brain dead after a medical emergency led him to being hospitalized earlier today. According to several news reports, it's unclear what medical emergency led him to the hospital to begin with but sources have now said that the wrestling legend's is no longer functioning although his other organs are still working at this time. Ric Flair is still on a breathing machine until his family gives permission to disconnect him but as of now, he is declared brain dead, thus legally dead. Flair was in the metro Atlanta area when he was rushed to the hospital. Sources have not confirmed his medical emergency and TMZ reported that it was very serious. Pro Wrestling Sheet reported that Flair has been suffering from a heart condition as of late and that his hospitalization was in relation to that. Without confirmation, fans have been left to speculate. In 2017, Ric Flair was hospitalized after a medical scare which resulted in surgery. Flair was had only a 20% chance of survival which he beat.\nScreenshot of https://lfrsolutions.com/wwe-legend-ric-flair-declared-brain-dead/\nUsers on social media only saw this title and thumbnail, offering no clue the story was fake:\nWe checked TMZ and they did indeed post a story on May 17, 2019 about Flair being hospitalized after a \"very serious\" medical emergency:\nBut they have since updated that article with a new headline that says \"RIC FLAIR EXPECTED TO MAKE FULL RECOVERY... Wife Says\". And the story makes no mention about brain death.\nThe site LFR Solutions comes with a disclaimer at the bottom of every page that reads:\nThe stories posted on lfrsolutions.com are for entertainment purposes only. The stories may mimic articles found in the headlines, but rest assured they are purely satirical.\nHowever that disclaimer is between four and five pixels tall so it is hardly legible on most screens.

And does the simultaneous breaking of 20 bones equal 57 del too? No, that's not true: there is no such unit of measurement. A unit with a similar name briefly used in the middle of last century (the \"\"dol\"\") only had a scale that went from 1 to 10.\nThe claim is often made in a viral image, for example in this post (archived here). The text on the image typically reads:\nA human body can bear only up to 45 del (units) of pain. Yet at time of giving birth, a mother feels up to 57 del (units) of pain. This is similar to 20 bones getting fractured at a time.\nScreenshot of https://www.facebook.com/DavidAvocadoWolfe/photos/10153493082606512/\nThe mathematics don't make sense to begin with: if human bodies can only bear 45 \"\"del\"\" and every birth causes \"\"57\"\" del of pain it would mean mothers are not human. My mom does not agree, and most mothers probably won't subscribe to this view either.\nAlso, there is no unit of measurement called the \"\"del\"\". The \"\"dol\"\" was briefly used around 1950 by a trio of researchers (James D. Hardy, Harold G. Wolff and Helen Goodell ) to measure pain, you can read a Time story from 1956 about it here. But their scale only went from 1 to 10.\nHere's a typical example of the nonsense claim:\ndel.jpg\nWhile it is probably being shared and liked so often to honor the pain and love of mothers everywhere, the claim itself is complete nonsense.\"",

        "text": "Did Chicago police find records on actor Jussie Smollett's phone that show just before his staged attack he was in contact with U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who is purportedly his aunt, in an plot to orchestrate the start of a race war? No, that's not true. There were no records found of contact between the two senators -- who are also candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination -- before the January 2019 incident, and Kamala Harris is not Smollett's aunt.\nThe stories originated in mid-February 2019 after it became clear that Smollett had staged the purported racial attack, and the false claims continue to spread on social media, including in a post (archived here) shared on May 18, 2019 in the form of a meme featuring a photo of the \"\"Empire\"\" actor. It read:\nIt's been reported Chicago police found on Jussie's phone records that, just before the \"\"attack\"\", he was in contact with Booker and his Aunt, Kamala Harris.\nOrchestrated from the TOP.\nTried to start a race war & FAILED\nScreenshot of https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217653122216120&set=a.1713746239755&type=3&theater\nThis is what social media users saw:\nSmollett, 36, claimed that he was attacked by two white men on a Chicago street in the early morning hours of January 29, 2019. He said the masked attackers were yelling racial and homophobic slurs, and that one said \"\"This is MAGA country,\"\" a reference to Donald Trump's slogan \"\"Make America Great Again.\"\"\nSen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, tweeted that day that Smollett \"\"is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know.\"\" She then concluded the attack was \"\"an attempted modern day lynching.\"\"\nKamala Harris\n✔\n@KamalaHarris\n .@JussieSmollett is one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know.

Police charged Smollett with filing a false police report on February 20, 2019.\nSen. Harris posted a Facebook message that day saying she was \"\"sad, frustrated, and disappointed.\"\"\nHe was indicted by a grand jury for 16 felonies on March 8, 2019.Controversy erupted later in the month when prosecutors announced all charges were dropped with Smollett agreeing to forfiet his $10,000 bond and complete 16 hours of community service. Chicago authorities were still sorting through questions about how police, prosecutors, and the court handle the Smollett case, with calls for special prosecutor to be named to investigate.\nThe unusual handling of the Smollett case proved to be good fodder for exaggerted and inaccurate reporting, including one that claimed an \"\"unnamed source\"\" said Smollett's phone records showed over 200 calls and texts from Kamala Harris and DNC operatives. The report said that revelation is what led to the charges being dismissed.\nOne apparent origin of the mythical conspiracy is an anonymous message on a 4Chan thread (archived here) posted on February 15, 2019:\nThis puppy is tied to Kamala. There is a chance this will come out. CPD is pissed about the situation. They had the phone records before the spreadsheet was given to them. They also had the two Nigerians from following them on video from walking to taxis, etc. They had payment records. The interview on Good Morning America will be damning. Detectives have been 2 steps ahead the whole time. Would suggest for people to contact their representatives to have Kamala investigated. She is involved and wish I could tell you how I know. Just contact your reps and push for them to look into this. It may help.\nThat post was used by a website for a false story titled \"\"Kamala Harris Was Allegedly Involved In Jussie Smollett's 'MAGA Country' Hoax\"\".\nLead Stories debunked that report with our own titled \"\"Fake News: NO Unnamed Source Said Jussie Smollett Phone Records Showed Over 200 Calls And Texts From Kamala Harris and DNC operatives.\"\"\nAs for the claim that Smollett is Harris's nephew, there is no evidence it is true. Yes, Smollett's mom's maiden name is Harris and she was born in California, as was the senator. But Harris is a common surname and California is a huge state. Kamala Harris had just one sister, Maya, according to her mother's 2009 obituary.\"",

It wasn't us who started this war, it wasn't us. But it's our job to end it. And we're ready for a dialogue,” Zelenskiy said.\nThe head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, used the Telegram messaging service to express discontent with Zelenskiy’s statement, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\nKadyrov said Zelenskiy’s inauguration speech had likely been “edited abroad,” otherwise he “would not be making belligerent statements on the first day” of his presidency “threatening to seize the territory of a neighboring state.”\nThe Chechen leader was referring to the Crimean peninsula, which he said \"was, is, and forever will be an integral part of Russia.\"\nPolygraph.info has repeatedly checked false claims that Russia is not occupying Ukrainian territory.\nBut did Zelensky threaten to take any territory, neighboring or otherwise, by force?\nThe Ukrainian president did say that, after ending the war in the Donbas, the next challenge was “the return of [Ukraine’s] lost territories,” adding that it was “impossible to lose something that rightfully belongs to us.”\n“Both Crimea and [the Donbas region] are Ukrainian lands. We didn't just lose the territories, we lost the most important thing: the people,” Zelensky said.\nThat opinion was backed up by the March 27, 2014 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262. It stated that the Russian-led referendum to annex Crimea, carried out under military occupation, had “no validity” and “cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol.”\nThe resolution urged all countries “not to recognize any alteration of the status” of Crimea, which the majority of the international community has adhered to.\nWhile Zelenskiy spoke of winning back the “conscience” of the people in those areas whom the government had failed to make “feel Ukrainian,” he did not suggest “seizing” Crimea or otherwise regaining the peninsula via military action.\nPolygraph.info therefore finds Kadyrov’s statement to be false.",
