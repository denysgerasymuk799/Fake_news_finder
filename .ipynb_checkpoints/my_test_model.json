    "text": "SUMMARY\nRussia agrees with China’s stance on US and Western interventions in Hong Kong. China has compelling evidence that the United States and Western countries are behind the protests and illegal actions in the province of Hong Kong. \nDISPROOF\nA recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative and conspiracy theory about the Hong Kong protests presented without evidence.\nPro-Kremlin media have long used the narrative about anti-government protests being funded by the US. Examples include colour revolutions in post-Soviet states, the “Arab Spring” revolts, and Ukraine's Euromaidan in 2014. Western non-governmental organisations are often targeted by pro-Kremlin disinformation as agents of this subversive and state-driven influence.\nThe Hong Kong protests began in June 2019 because of a controversial extradition law that would allow for the transfer of suspects to face trial on the Chinese mainland.\nFor similar cases, see here.",
